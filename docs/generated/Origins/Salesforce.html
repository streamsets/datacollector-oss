 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Salesforce origin reads data from Salesforce.</p>

        <p class="p">When you configure the
            Salesforce origin, you define connection information that the origin uses to connect to
            Salesforce, including the API type and version that the origin uses to connect to
            Salesforce. </p>

        <p class="p">You can configure the origin to read data in one or both of the following ways: </p>

        <ul class="ul" id="concept_odf_vr3_rx__ul_kr4_1np_tx">
            <li class="li">Execute a query to read existing data from Salesforce. </li>

            <li class="li">Subscribe to the Force.com Streaming API to receive notifications for changes to
                Salesforce data.</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">When processing existing data, you can configure the origin to query Salesforce at
            regular intervals. You cannot use repeating queries when subscribed to notifications.
            When repeating a query, the origin can perform a full or incremental read. </p>

        <p class="p">The origin generates Salesforce record header attributes and Salesforce field attributes
            that provide additional information about each record and field. The origin also <span class="ph">includes the CRUD operation type in a record header attribute
                        so generated records can be easily processed by CRUD-enabled destinations.
                        For an overview of <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> changed
                        data processing and a list of CRUD-enabled destinations, see <a class="xref" href="../Pipeline_Design/CDC-Overview.html#concept_apw_l2c_ty">Processing Changed Data</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="p">You can optionally use an HTTP proxy to connect to Salesforce.</p>

        <p class="p">The origin can also generate events for an event
                  stream. For more information about dataflow triggers and the event framework, see
                        <a class="xref" href="../Event_Handling/EventFramework-Title.html#concept_cph_5h4_lx">Dataflow Triggers Overview</a>. </p>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Query Existing Data</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Salesforce origin can execute a query to read existing data from Salesforce. Use the
        Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) to write the query.</p>

        <p class="p">When
            you configure the origin to query existing data, you specify whether the origin uses the
            Salesforce Bulk API or SOAP API to read from Salesforce. The Bulk API is optimized to
            process large sets of data. The SOAP API supports more complex queries, but is less
            practical when processing large sets of data. For more information about when to use the
            Bulk or SOAP API, see the Salesforce Developer documentation. </p>

        <p class="p">If the origin uses the SOAP API or uses the Bulk API version <span class="ph">39.0</span> or later, you can configure the origin to retrieve deleted records from the
            Salesforce recycle bin.</p>

        <p class="p">The Salesforce origin uses an offset field and initial offset value to determine where to
            start reading data within an object. Include both the offset field and the offset value
            in the WHERE clause of the SOQL query. By default, the offset field is defined as the
            Salesforce <samp class="ph systemoutput">Id</samp> field. The <samp class="ph codeph">Id</samp> system field
            contains a unique identifier for each record in a Salesforce object. The initial offset
            value is a value within the offset field where you want the Salesforce origin to start
            reading. </p>

        <p class="p">If you configure the origin to query existing data but not to subscribe to notifications,
            you can configure the origin to run the query once or to repeat the query. When running
            the query once, the pipeline stops when it finishes reading all data from the Salesforce
            object. If you start the pipeline again, the origin uses the initial offset value to
            start reading, reading the entire set of existing data again. </p>

        <p class="p">If the pipeline stops before it finishes reading all data, the Salesforce origin saves
            the last read offset value. When the pipeline starts again, the origin uses the last
            read offset value to continue processing from where it stopped. You can reset the origin
            to process all requested objects. When you configure the origin to run the query more
            than once, the pipeline runs continuously so it can repeat the query at regular
            intervals. You can choose how the origin repeats the query. For more information, see
                <a class="xref" href="Salesforce.html#concept_owv_nj5_2z">Repeat Query</a>.</p>

        <p class="p">When the origin is configured to subscribe to notifications, the pipeline runs
            continuously so that it can receive changed events. If you configure the origin to both
            query existing data and to subscribe to notifications, the origin first subscribes for
            changes, then queries for existing data. The changes are queued and processed after the
            query is complete. As a result, some changes might be processed twice. </p>

<div class="topic concept nested2" id="concept_vdt_dxc_tx">
 <h3 class="title topictitle3">SOQL Query</h3>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">When you configure the Salesforce origin to query existing data, you define the SOQL
        query that the origin uses to return data from Salesforce. The Salesforce origin requires a
        WHERE and ORDER BY clause in the query. </p>

        <p class="p">Use the following
            guidelines when you define the WHERE and ORDER BY clauses:</p>

        <dl class="dl">
            
                <dt class="dt dlterm">In the WHERE clause, include the offset field and the offset value</dt>

                <dd class="dd">The origin uses an offset field and value to determine the data that is
                    returned. Include both in the WHERE clause of the query. </dd>

            
            
                <dt class="dt dlterm">Use the OFFSET constant to represent the offset value</dt>

                <dd class="dd">In the WHERE clause, use ${OFFSET} to represent the offset value. </dd>

                <dd class="dd">For example, when you start a pipeline, the following query returns all data
                    from the object where the data in the offset field is greater than the initial
                    offset
                        value:<pre class="pre codeblock">SELECT Id, Name FROM &lt;object&gt; WHERE &lt;offset field&gt; &gt; ${OFFSET}</pre>
<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> When the offset values are strings, enclose ${OFFSET} in single
                        quotation marks.</div>
</dd>

            
            
                <dt class="dt dlterm">In the ORDER BY clause, include the offset field as the first field</dt>

                <dd class="dd">To avoid returning duplicate data, use the offset field as the first field in
                    the ORDER BY clause.</dd>

                <dd class="dd">
                    <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Using a field that is not the <samp class="ph systemoutput">Id</samp> field in the
                        ORDER BY clause can slow performance. </div>

                </dd>

            
        </dl>

        <p class="p">The complete SOQL query must use the following syntax:</p>

        <pre class="pre codeblock">SELECT &lt;offset field&gt;, &lt;field name1&gt;, &lt;field name2&gt;, ... FROM &lt;object&gt; WHERE &lt;offset field&gt; &gt; ${OFFSET} ORDER BY &lt;offset field&gt;</pre>

        <p class="p">If you specify <samp class="ph codeph">SELECT * FROM &lt;object&gt;</samp> in the SOQL query, the origin
            expands <samp class="ph codeph">*</samp> to all fields in the Salesforce object that are accessible to
            the configured user. Note that the origin adds components of compound fields to the
            query, rather than adding the compound fields themselves. For example, the origin adds
            BillingStreet, BillingCity, etc., rather than adding BillingAddress. Similarly, it adds
            Location__Latitude__s and Location__Longitude__s rather than Location__c.</p>

            Salesforce Bulk API. You use the default value of  <samp class="ph codeph">Id</samp> for the offset
            field. You use the default value of <samp class="ph codeph">000000000000000</samp> for the offset
            value to ensure that the origin reads all records in the object. </p>

        <p class="p">You define the SOQL query as follows, including the offset field and offset value in the

 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Salesforce origin can subscribe to the Force.com Streaming API to receive
        notifications for changes to Salesforce data.</p>

  <p class="p">To
            configure the origin to subscribe to notifications, you must first create a PushTopic in
            Salesforce based on an SOQL query. The PushTopic query defines which record create,
            update, delete, or undelete events generate a notification. If the record changes match
            the criteria of the PushTopic query, a notification is generated and received by the
            subscribed clients. </p>

        <p class="p">The Salesforce origin is the client that subscribes to the PushTopic. In the origin
            configuration, you specify the name of the PushTopic, which subscribes the origin to the
            PushTopic channel.</p>

        <p class="p">When you start a pipeline configured to subscribe to Salesforce notifications, the

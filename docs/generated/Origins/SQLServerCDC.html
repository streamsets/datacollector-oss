        <p class="p">The SQL Server
            CDC Client origin processes data in Microsoft SQL Server change data capture (CDC)
            tables. The origin uses multiple threads to enable parallel processing of data. </p>

        <p class="p">Use the SQL Server CDC Client origin to generate records from CDC tables. To read data
            from Microsoft SQL Server change tracking tables, use the <a class="xref" href="SQLServerChange.html#concept_ewq_b2s_r1b" title="You can define the initial order that the origin uses to read the tables.">SQL Server Change Tracking
                origin</a>. For more information about the differences between CDC and change
            tracking data, see the <a class="xref" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/track-data-changes-sql-server" target="_blank">Microsoft SQL Server documentation</a>.</p>

        <p class="p">The SQL Server CDC Client origin includes the CRUD operation type in a record header
            attribute so generated records can be easily processed by CRUD-enabled destinations. For
            an overview of <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
            changed data processing and a list of CRUD-enabled destinations, see <a class="xref" href="../Pipeline_Design/CDC-Overview.html#concept_apw_l2c_ty">Processing Changed Data</a>. </p>

        <p class="p">Note that the origin supports the SQL Server insert and delete operations. Updates
            captured after the update operation are treated as update, and updates captured before
            the update operation are treated as an unsupported operation.</p>

        <p class="p">You might use this origin to perform database replication. You can use a separate
            pipeline with the JDBC Query Consumer or JDBC Multitable Consumer origin to read
            existing data. Then start a pipeline with the SQL Server CDC Client origin to process
            subsequent changes.</p>

        <p class="p">When you configure the origin, you specify the SQL Server source table names - the origin
            processes the related CDC tables. You can define groups of tables in the same database
            and any initial offsets to use. When you omit initial offsets, the origin processes all
            available data in the CDC tables.</p>

        <p class="p">To determine how the origin connects to the database, you specify connection information,
            a query interval, number of retries, and any custom JDBC configuration properties that
            you need. </p>

        <p class="p">To use a JDBC version older than 4.0, you can specify the driver class name and define a
            health check query.</p>

        <p class="p">The origin can also generate events for an event
                  stream. For more information about dataflow triggers and the event framework, see
                        <a class="xref" href="../Event_Handling/EventFramework-Title.html#concept_cph_5h4_lx">Dataflow Triggers Overview</a>. </p>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Multithreaded Processing</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">The SQL Server CDC Client origin
            performs parallel processing and enables the creation of a multithreaded pipeline. </p>

        <p class="p">When you start the pipeline, the SQL Server CDC Client origin retrieves the list of CDC
            tables associated with the source tables defined in the table configurations. The origin
            then uses multiple concurrent threads based on the Number of Threads property. Each
            thread reads data from a single table. </p>

        <div class="p">
            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The Maximum Pool Size property on the Advanced tab defines the maximum number of
                connections the origin can make to the database. It must be equal to or greater than
                the value defined for the Number of Threads property.</div>

        </div>

        <p class="p">As the pipeline runs, <span class="ph">each thread connects to the origin system
                        and creates a batch of data, and passes the batch to an available pipeline
                        runner. A pipeline runner is a <dfn class="term">sourceless pipeline instance</dfn> -
                        an instance of the pipeline that includes all of the processors and
                        destinations in the pipeline and performs all pipeline processing after the
                        origin.</span></p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph"> Each pipeline runner processes one batch at a time,
                        just like a pipeline that runs on a single thread. When the flow of data
                        slows, the pipeline runners wait idly until they are needed.</span></p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph">Multithreaded pipelines preserve the order of
                        records within each batch, just like a single-threaded pipeline. But since
                        batches are processed by different pipeline instances, the order that
                        batches are written to destinations is not ensured.</span></p>

        <p class="p">For more information about multithreaded pipelines, see <a class="xref" href="../Multithreaded_Pipelines/MultithreadedPipelines.html#concept_zpp_2xc_py">Multithreaded Pipeline Overview</a>.</p>

        <div class="section" id="concept_ofh_gns_r1b__section_fvq_bpw_hz"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Example</h3>
            
            <p class="p">Say you are reading from 10 tables. You set the Number of Threads property to 5 and
                the Maximum Pool Size property to 6. When you start the pipeline, the origin
                retrieves the list of tables. The origin then creates five threads to read from the
                first five tables, and by default <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> creates a matching number of pipeline runners. Upon receiving data, a thread
                passes a batch to each of the pipeline runners for processing.</p>

            <p class="p">At any given moment, the five pipeline runners can each
                  process a batch, so this multithreaded pipeline processes up to five batches at a
                  time. When incoming data slows, the pipeline runners sit idle, available for use
                  as soon as the data flow increases.</p>

                        the same process. When the first thread finishes reading from table3, the

                        tables whose names start with "st". The default pattern, %, matches all

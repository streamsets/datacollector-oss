 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Multithreaded Processing</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The CoAP Server origin performs parallel processing and enables the creation of a
        multithreaded pipeline. </p>

        <p class="p">The CoAP Server origin uses multiple concurrent
            threads based on the Max Concurrent Requests property. <span class="ph">Each
                              thread connects to the origin system and creates a batch of data, and
                              passes the batch to an available pipeline runner.</span></p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph">A pipeline runner is a <dfn class="term">sourceless
                              pipeline instance</dfn> - an instance of the pipeline that includes
                        all of the processors and destinations in the pipeline and represents all
                        pipeline processing after the origin.</span>
            <span class="ph"> Each pipeline runner processes one batch at a time,
                        just like a pipeline that runs on a single thread. When the flow of data
                        slows, the pipeline runners wait idly until they are needed.</span></p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph">Multithreaded pipelines preserve the order of
                        records within each batch, just like a single-threaded pipeline. But since
                        batches are processed by different pipeline instances, the order that
                        batches are written to destinations is not ensured.</span></p>

        <p class="p">For example, say you set the Max Concurrent Requests property to 5. When you start the
            pipeline, <span class="ph"><span class="ph" id="concept_mbt_tx3_tz__d42523e2359">the origin creates five
                              threads, and <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> creates a matching number of pipeline runners.</span>
                        <span class="ph" id="concept_mbt_tx3_tz__d42523e2364">Upon receiving data, the origin passes a batch to
                              each of the pipeline runners for processing.</span>
                  </span>
        </p>

        <p class="p">At any given moment, the five pipeline runners can each
                  process a batch, so this multithreaded pipeline processes up to five batches at a
                  time. When incoming data slows, the pipeline runners sit idle, available for use
                  as soon as the data flow increases.</p>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Network Configuration Properties</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The CoAP Server origin uses the default values for network configuration properties as
        implemented by Eclipse Californium. If needed, you can override the default values of these
        properties.</p>

  <div class="p">The
            default values of each property are listed on <a class="xref" href="https://github.com/eclipse/californium/blob/master/californium-core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/californium/core/network/config/NetworkConfigDefaults.java" target="_blank">this page</a>. The origin uses the defaults for
            all network configuration properties except for the following:<ul class="ul" id="concept_ktx_jxx_tz__ul_wkp_1zx_tz">
                <li class="li">COAP_PORT - You set the port number in the CoAP Listening Port property for the
                    origin.</li>

                <li class="li">NETWORK_STAGE_RECEIVER_THREAD_COUNT - You set the number of threads in the Max
                    Concurrent Requests property for the origin.</li>

            </ul>
</div>

        <p class="p">For example, the origin uses the default value of 2000 for the ACK_TIMEOUT network
            configuration property. To override the default value, add ACK_TIMEOUT as an additional
            network configuration property and set the property to the desired value, such as
            1000.</p>

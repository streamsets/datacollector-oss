 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Multithreaded Processing</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">The HTTP Server origin performs parallel
            processing and enables the creation of a multithreaded pipeline. </p>

        <p class="p">The HTTP Server origin uses multiple concurrent threads based on the Max Concurrent
            Requests property. <span class="ph">When you start the pipeline, the origin creates the
                        specified number of threads and <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> creates a matching number of <dfn class="term">pipeline runners</dfn> to perform
                        pipeline processing. The origin creates batches and passes each batch to a
                        pipeline runner. Each pipeline runner runs a <dfn class="term">sourceless pipeline
                              instance</dfn> - an instance of the pipeline that includes all of the
                        processors and destinations in the pipeline and performs all pipeline
                        processing after the origin.</span></p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph"> Each pipeline runner can process one batch at a time,
                        just like a pipeline that runs on a single thread. When the flow of data
                        slows, the pipeline runners wait idly until they are needed.</span></p>

        <p class="p">For example, say you set the Max Concurrent Requests property to 5. When you start the
            pipeline, <span class="ph">the origin creates five threads, and <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> creates five pipeline runners. Upon receiving data, the origin passes a
                        batch to each of the pipeline runners for processing. </span> In the batch, HTTP Server includes only the HTTP POST requests with the specified
            Application ID. </p>

        <p class="p">Conceptually, the multithreaded pipeline looks like this:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_ldf_chp_qy__image_r5x_532_ry" src="../Graphics/Multithread-HTTPThreads.png" height="487" width="585" /></p>

        <p class="p">Each pipeline runner performs the processing associated with the rest of the pipeline.
            After a batch is written to pipeline destinations, the pipeline runner becomes available
            for another batch of data. Each batch is processed and written as quickly as possible,
            independent from other batches processed by other pipeline runners, so batches may be
            written differently from the read-order.</p>

        <p class="p">At any given moment, the five pipeline runners can each
                  process a batch, so this multithreaded pipeline processes up to five batches at a
                  time. When incoming data slows, the pipeline runners sit idle, available for use
                  as soon as the data flow increases.</p>

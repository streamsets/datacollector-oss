        <p class="p">When generating multiple records, you specify the multiple value behavior: one record

            with one record for each value. </p>

        <p class="p">You can optionally specify an output field to use for the data. When not specified, the

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Packet Queue</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">The UDP Multithreaded Source origin uses a packet
            queue to hold incoming data in memory until the data can be incorporated in a batch and

            dropped. The number of packets that are dropped is noted in <a class="xref" href="UDPMulti.html#concept_lbj_slg_5bb">stage metrics</a>. </p>

        <p class="p">When you configure the origin, you can specify the maximum number of packets to allow in

 <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">The UDP Multithreaded Source origin
            performs parallel processing and enables the creation of a multithreaded pipeline. </p>

        <p class="p">When you enable multithreaded processing, the UDP Multithreaded Source origin uses
            multiple concurrent threads for pipeline processing based on the Number of Worker
            Threads property. When you start the pipeline, the origin creates the number of threads
            specified in the property. </p>

        <p class="p">As packets arrive from the specified UDP ports, they enter the packet queue. There is a
            single instance of the packet queue per pipeline. All receiver threads (which can be
            more than one, when using epoll) place packets onto the queue. At the same time, each
            worker thread removes packets from the queue, parses them according to the specified
            data format, and processes the rest of the pipeline using a pipeline runner.</p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph">A pipeline runner is a <dfn class="term">sourceless
                              pipeline instance</dfn> - an instance of the pipeline that includes
                        all of the processors and destinations in the pipeline and represents all
                        pipeline processing after the origin.</span>
            <span class="ph"> Each pipeline runner processes one batch at a time,
                        just like a pipeline that runs on a single thread. When the flow of data
                        slows, the pipeline runners wait idly until they are needed.</span></p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph">Multithreaded pipelines preserve the order of
                        records within each batch, just like a single-threaded pipeline. But since
                        batches are processed by different pipeline instances, the order that
                        batches are written to destinations is not ensured.</span></p>

        <p class="p">For example, say you enable multithreaded processing and set the Number of Worker Threads
            property to 5. When you start the pipeline, <span class="ph">the origin creates five
                              threads, and <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> creates a matching number of pipeline runners.</span> The origin adds incoming data to the packet queue, creates batches of data from the
            queue and then passes the batches to the pipeline runners for processing.</p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph">Each pipeline runner performs the processing associated
                        with the rest of the pipeline. After a batch is written to pipeline
                        destinations, the pipeline runner becomes available for another batch of
                        data. Each batch is processed and written as quickly as possible,
                        independent from other batches processed by other pipeline runners, so
                        batches may be written differently from the read-order.</span></p>

        <p class="p">At any given moment, the five pipeline runners can each
                  process a batch, so this multithreaded pipeline processes up to five batches at a
                  time. When incoming data slows, the pipeline runners sit idle, available for use
                  as soon as the data flow increases.</p>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Metrics for Performance Tuning</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">The UDP Multithreaded Source origin provides
            packet queue metrics that you can use to tune pipeline performance. </p>

        <div class="p">The origin provides the following packet queue metrics:<ul class="ul" id="concept_lbj_slg_5bb__ul_itx_kpg_5bb">
                <li class="li">Dropped Packets - The number of packets that were dropped because the packet
                    queue was full.</li>

                <li class="li">Queue Size - The current size of the packet queue. </li>

                <li class="li">Queued Packets - The total number of packets that have passed through the packet
                    queue for processing. </li>

            </ul>
</div>

        <p class="p">These metrics can help you determine how to improve pipeline performance. For example, if
            you have a high volume of dropped packets and the queue size seems to be maxed out as
            you monitor the pipeline, you might increase the number of worker threads for the
            pipeline to allow for greater throughput. Or, if you have relatively high bursts of data
            volume and find packets getting dropped during those bursts, consider increasing the
            packet queue size to better accommodate them.</p>

        <p class="p">If the queue size is not maxed out, but the number of queued packets does not seem as
            high as you expect, you might be dropping packets on the operating system side. When
            epoll is available - that is, when <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
            runs on recent versions of 64-bit Linux - increasing the number of receiver threads can
            increase the volume of packets that are passed to the origin.</p>

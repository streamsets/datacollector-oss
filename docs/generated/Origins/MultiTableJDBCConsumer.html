 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The JDBC Multitable Consumer origin reads database data from multiple tables through a
        JDBC connection. The origin returns data as a map with column names and field
        values.</p>

  <p class="p">When you
            configure the origin, you define groups of database tables to read. The origin generates
            SQL queries based on the table configurations that you define. The origin uses multiple
            threads to enable parallel processing of data. Use the JDBC Multitable Consumer origin
            to read multiple tables in the same database. For example, you might want to use the
            origin for database replication. </p>

        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> To configure your own SQL query to read database data from a single table or from a
            join of tables, use the <a class="xref" href="JDBCConsumer.html#concept_qhf_hjr_bs" title="JDBC Query Consumer uses an offset column and initial offset value to determine where to start reading data within a table. Include both the offset column and the offset value in the WHERE clause of the SQL query. JDBC Query Consumer supports recovery after a deliberate or unexpected stop when it performs incremental queries. Recovery is not supported for full queries.When you define the SQL query for incremental mode, JDBC Query Consumer requires a WHERE and ORDER BY clause in the query. You can define any type of SQL query for full mode.">JDBC Query Consumer</a>
            origin.</div>

        <p class="p">When you configure JDBC Multitable Consumer, you specify connection information, a query
            interval, and custom JDBC configuration properties to determine how the origin connects
            to the database. </p>

        <p class="p">You define a table configuration for each group of tables that you want to read. You
            define the number of threads that the origin uses to read from the tables and the
            strategy that the origin uses to create each batch of data. You also define the initial
            order that the origin uses to read the tables.</p>

        <p class="p">When the pipeline stops, JDBC Multitable Consumer notes where it stops reading. When the
            pipeline starts again, JDBC Multitable Consumer continues processing from where it
            stopped by default. You can reset the origin to process all available data.</p>

        <p class="p">To use a JDBC version older than 4.0, you can specify the driver class name and define a
            health check query.</p>

        <p class="p">The origin can also generate events for an event
                  stream. For more information about dataflow triggers and the event framework, see

                        an instance of the pipeline that includes all of the processors and

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Table Configuration</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">When you configure JDBC Multitable Consumer, you define a table configuration for each
        group of tables that you want to read. A table configuration defines a group of tables from
        the same schema, that have the same table name pattern, and that have proper primary keys or
        have the same defined offset columns.</p>

        <p class="p">You can define one or more
            table configurations. </p>

        <p class="p">For example, you can define one table configuration to replicate a database that has a
            proper primary key for each table. You simply define the schema name and use the default
            table name pattern <samp class="ph codeph">%</samp> which matches all tables in the schema.</p>

        <div class="p">Let's look at an example where you need to define more than one table configuration.
            Let's say that you want to copy tables in a relational database to an HBase cluster. The
            SALES schema contains ten tables, but you want to copy only the following four
                tables:<ul class="ul" id="concept_rx3_3hx_4y__ul_ivp_hcy_4y">
                <li class="li">store_a</li>

                <li class="li">customers</li>

            </ul>
</div>

        <p class="p">The three store tables use orderID as the primary key. You want to override the primary
            key for the customers table, and so need to define customerID as the offset column for
            that table. You want to read all available data in the tables, so do not need to define
            an initial offset value.</p>

        <p class="p">You define the following two table configurations for the origin so that the origin can
            read all four tables:</p>

        <p class="p">Let's take a closer look at the table name pattern and offset properties that you define

 <h3 class="title topictitle3">Table Name Pattern</h3>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You define the group of tables that the JDBC Multitable Consumer origin reads by
        defining a table name pattern for the table configuration. The origin reads all tables whose
        names match the pattern. </p>

  <p class="p">The table name pattern uses
            the SQL LIKE syntax. For example, the LIKE syntax uses the percentage wildcard (%) to
            represent any string of zero or more characters. The table name pattern
                <samp class="ph codeph">st%</samp> matches tables whose names start with "st". The default table

        <p class="p">You can optionally define a table exclusion pattern to exclude some tables from being

 <h3 class="title topictitle3">Offset Column and Value</h3>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The JDBC Multitable Consumer origin uses an offset column and initial offset value to
        determine where to start reading data within the tables. </p>

        <p class="p">By default, the origin uses the
            primary key of the tables as the offset column and uses no initial offset value. When a
            table has a composite primary key, the origin uses each primary key as an offset column.
            The origin reads all available data from each table when you start the pipeline. </p>

        <div class="p">When you use the default behavior, the origin generates SQL queries using the following
            syntax when you start the
            pipeline:<pre class="pre codeblock">SELECT * FROM &lt;table&gt; ORDER BY &lt;offset column_1&gt;, &lt;offset column_2&gt;, ...</pre>
</div>

        <p class="p">Where <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;offset column_<em class="ph i">n</em>&gt;</samp> represents each primary key of the
            table, such as when the table has a composite primary key. When you restart the pipeline
            or when the origin switches back to a previously read table, the origin adds a WHERE
            clause to the SQL query to continue reading from the last saved offset.</p>

        <p class="p">To use the default behavior, you do not need to configure any of the offset
            properties.</p>

        <div class="p">You can make the following changes to how the origin handles offset columns and initial
            offset values:<dl class="dl">
                
                    <dt class="dt dlterm">Override the primary key as the offset column</dt>

                    <dd class="dd">You can override the primary key and define another offset column or
                        columns. Or if the table doesn’t have a primary key, you can define the
                        offset column or columns to use. The offset columns that you define should
                        be an incremental and unique columns, such as an indexed column.</dd>

                
                
                    <dt class="dt dlterm">Define an initial offset value</dt>

                    <dd class="dd">The initial offset value is a value within the offset column where you want
                        JDBC Multitable Consumer to start reading. When you define an initial offset
                        value, you must first enter the offset column name and then the value. If
                        you are using the default primary key as the offset column, enter the name
                        of the primary key.</dd>

                    <dd class="dd">If you define an initial offset value for a single offset column, the origin
                        generates SQL queries using the following
                        syntax:<pre class="pre codeblock">SELECT * FROM &lt;table&gt; ORDER BY &lt;offset column&gt; WHERE &lt;offset column&gt; &gt; ${offset}</pre>
</dd>

                    <dd class="dd">If you defined multiple offset columns, you must define an initial offset
                        value for each column, in the same order that the columns are defined. The
                        origin uses the initial offset values of all columns to determine where to
                        start reading data. For example, you override the primary key with the
                        following offset columns: p1, p2, p3 and define an initial offset value for
                        each column. The origin generates SQL queries using the following
                                syntax:<pre class="pre codeblock">SELECT * FROM &lt;table&gt; ORDER BY p1, p2, p3 WHERE (p1 &gt; ${offset1}) OR (p1 = ${offset1} AND p2 &gt; ${offset2}) OR (p1 = ${offset1} AND p2 = ${offset2} AND p3 &gt; ${offset3})</pre>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> <span class="ph">Data

                            value. You can use the time functions to transform a Datetime value to a
                            Long value. For example, the following expression converts a date
                            entered as a String to a Date object, and then to a Long
                            value:<pre class="pre codeblock">${time:dateTimeToMilliseconds(time:extractDateFromString('2017-05-01 20:15:30.915','yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS'))} </pre>

                    <dd class="dd">You can use the expression language to define additional conditions that the
                        origin uses to determine where to start reading data. The origin adds the
                        defined condition to the WHERE clause of the SQL query.</dd>

                    <dd class="dd">You can use the offset:column function in the condition to access an offset
                        column by position. For example, if you have a table with offset columns p1
                        and p2, then offset:column(0) returns the value of p1 while offset:column(1)
                        returns the value of p2.</dd>

                    <dd class="dd">Let's say that you defined a transaction_time column as the offset column.
                        While the origin reads the table, multiple active transactions are being
                        written to the table with the current timestamp for the transaction_time
                        column. When the origin finishes reading the first record with the current
                        timestamp, the origin continues reading with the next offset and skips some
                        rows with the current timestamp. You can enter the following offset column
                        condition to ensure that the origin reads from all offset columns with a
                        timestamp less than the current
                            time:<pre class="pre codeblock">${offset:column(0)} &lt; ${time:now}</pre>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> As

</dd>

                <dd class="dd">Note that the referential constraints order can cause pipeline validation or

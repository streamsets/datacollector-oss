  <p class="p">When you
            configure the origin, you define groups of database tables to read. The origin generates
            SQL queries based on the table configurations that you define. Use the JDBC Multitable
            Consumer origin to read multiple tables in the same database. For example, you might
            want to use the origin for database replication.</p>

You can define any type of SQL query for full mode.">JDBC Query Consumer</a>
            origin.</div>

        <p class="p">When you configure JDBC Multitable Consumer, you specify connection information, a query
            interval, and custom JDBC configuration properties to determine how the origin connects
            to the database. </p>

        <p class="p">You define a table configuration for each group of tables that you want to read. You also
            define the strategy that the origin uses to create each batch of data and the order that
            the origin uses to read the tables.</p>

        <p class="p">When the pipeline stops, JDBC Multitable Consumer notes where it stops reading. When the
            pipeline starts again, JDBC Multitable Consumer continues processing from where it
            stopped by default. You can reset the origin to process all available data.</p>

        <p class="p">To use a JDBC version older than 4.0, you can specify the driver class name and define a

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Batch Strategy</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">The origin creates each batch of data
            from a single table. You can define one of the following strategies that the origin uses
            to create each batch:</p>

        <div class="p">
            <dl class="dl">

                        next table to create the next batch. </dd>

                    <dd class="dd">For example, let's say that the batch size for the origin is set to 100. The
                        origin is configured to read from two tables, each of which contains 1,000
                        rows. The origin creates the first batch when it reads 100 rows from table1.
                        Then, the origin switches to table2 and creates the second batch when it
                        reads 100 rows from table2.</dd>

                    <dd class="dd">When the origin runs an SQL query on a table, the database executes the
                        query and caches the result set in the database. When the origin creates
                        another batch from the same table, it retrieves the rows from the result set
                        cache in the database rather than running another SQL query.</dd>

                    <dd class="dd">For example, let's again assume that the batch size is 100 and the origin
                        reads from two tables, each of which contains 1,000 rows. The origin runs an
                        SQL query on table1, which returns all 1,000 rows. The origin creates a
                        batch when it reads the first 100 rows. The next 900 rows are cached as a
                        result set in the database. Then the origin runs an SQL query on table2,
                        repeating the process. After the origin sends the batch from table2, the
                        origin creates the next batch from table1 using the result set cache from
                        table1.</dd>

                    <dd class="dd">By default, the origin instructs the database to cache an unlimited number
                        of result sets. If you want to limit the number of cached result sets, you
                        can configure a result set cache size.</dd>

                        all batches created from the table. Then, the origin switches to the next
                        table, running another SQL query to read all available rows from that
                        table.</dd>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Table Configuration</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">When you configure JDBC Multitable Consumer, you define a table configuration for each
        group of tables that you want to read. A table configuration defines a group of tables from
        the same schema, that have the same table name pattern, and that have proper primary keys or
        have the same defined offset columns.</p>

        <p class="p">You can define one or more
            table configurations. </p>

        <p class="p">For example, you can define one table configuration to replicate a database that has a
            proper primary key for each table. You simply define the schema name and use the default
            table name pattern <samp class="ph codeph">%</samp> which matches all tables in the schema.</p>

        <div class="p">Let's look at an example where you need to define more than one table configuration.
            Let's say that you want to copy tables in a relational database to an HBase cluster. The
            SALES schema contains ten tables, but you want to copy only the following four
                tables:<ul class="ul" id="concept_rx3_3hx_4y__ul_ivp_hcy_4y">
                <li class="li">store_a</li>

                <li class="li">store_b</li>

                <li class="li">store_c</li>

                <li class="li">customers</li>

            </ul>
</div>

        <p class="p">The three store tables use orderID as the primary key. You want to override the primary
            key for the customers table, and so need to define customerID as the offset column for
            that table. You want to read all available data in the tables, so do not need to define
            an initial offset value.</p>

        <p class="p">You define the following two table configurations for the origin so that the origin can
            read all four tables:</p>

        <p class="p">Let's take a closer look at the table name pattern and offset properties that you define
            in a table configuration.</p>

 </div>

<div class="topic concept nested2" id="concept_ank_41x_4y">
 <h3 class="title topictitle3">Table Name Pattern</h3>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You define the group of tables that the JDBC Multitable Consumer origin reads by
        defining a table name pattern for the table configuration. The origin reads all tables whose
        names match the pattern. </p>

  <p class="p">The table name pattern uses
            the SQL LIKE syntax. For example, the LIKE syntax uses the percentage wildcard (%) to
            represent any string of zero or more characters. The table name pattern
                <samp class="ph codeph">st%</samp> matches tables whose names start with "st". The default table
            name pattern <samp class="ph codeph">%</samp> matches all tables in the schema.</p>

        <p class="p">For more information about valid patterns for the SQL LIKE syntax, see <a class="xref" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms179859.aspx" target="_blank">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms179859.aspx</a>.</p>

        <p class="p">You can optionally define a table exclusion pattern to exclude some tables from being
            read. The table exclusion pattern uses a Java-based regular expression, or regex. For
            more information about using regular expressions with <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>,
            see <a class="xref" href="../Apx-RegEx/RegEx-Title.html#concept_vd4_nsc_gs" title="A regular expression, also known as regex, describes a pattern for a string.">Regular Expressions Overview</a>.</p>

        <div class="p">For example, let's say that you want to read all tables in the schema except for tables
            that start with "dept". You enter the following table name and table exclusion patterns:
                <ul class="ul" id="concept_ank_41x_4y__ul_z3z_h2r_qy">
                <li class="li">Table Name Pattern - %</li>

                <li class="li">Table Exclusion Pattern - dept.*</li>

            </ul>
</div>

        <p class="p">If you do not need to exclude any tables, simply leave the table exclusion pattern
            empty.</p>

 <h3 class="title topictitle3">Offset Column and Value</h3>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The JDBC Multitable Consumer origin uses an offset column and initial offset value to
        determine where to start reading data within the tables. </p>

        <p class="p">By default, the origin uses the
            primary key of the tables as the offset column and uses no initial offset value. When a
            table has a composite primary key, the origin uses each primary key as an offset column.
            The origin reads all available data from each table when you start the pipeline. </p>

        <div class="p">When you use the default behavior, the origin generates SQL queries using the following

        <p class="p">Where <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;offset column_<em class="ph i">n</em>&gt;</samp> represents each primary key of the
            table, such as when the table has a composite primary key. When you restart the pipeline
            or when the origin switches back to a previously read table, the origin adds a WHERE
            clause to the SQL query to continue reading from the last saved offset.</p>

        <p class="p">To use the default behavior, you do not need to configure any of the offset
            properties.</p>

        <div class="p">You can make the following changes to how the origin handles offset columns and initial
            offset values:<dl class="dl">

                        be an incremental and unique columns, such as an indexed column.</dd>

                        JDBC Multitable Consumer to start reading. When you define an initial offset
                        value, you must first enter the offset column name and then the value. If
                        you are using the default primary key as the offset column, enter the name
                        of the primary key.</dd>

                        start reading data. For example, you override the primary key with the
                        following offset columns: p1, p2, p3 and define an initial offset value for
                        each column. The origin generates SQL queries using the following

                        defined condition to the WHERE clause of the SQL query.</dd>

                    <dd class="dd">You can use the offset:column function in the condition to access an offset
                        column by position. For example, if you have a table with offset columns p1
                        and p2, then offset:column(0) returns the value of p1 while offset:column(1)
                        returns the value of p2.</dd>

                    <dd class="dd">Let's say that you defined a transaction_time column as the offset column.
                        While the origin reads the table, multiple active transactions are being
                        written to the table with the current timestamp for the transaction_time
                        column. When the origin finishes reading the first record with the current
                        timestamp, the origin continues reading with the next offset and skips some
                        rows with the current timestamp. You can enter the following offset column
                        condition to ensure that the origin reads from all offset columns with a
                        timestamp less than the current
                            time:<pre class="pre codeblock">${offset:column(0)} &lt; ${time:now}</pre>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> As
                            a best practice, an offset column should be an incremental and unique

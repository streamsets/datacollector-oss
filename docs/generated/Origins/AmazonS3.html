 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Amazon S3 origin reads files stored in Amazon S3. The file names must all share a
        file name pattern and should be fully written.</p>

  <p class="p">With the Amazon S3 origin, you define the
      region, bucket, optional folder, file name pattern, and compression format. These properties
      determine the files that the origin processes. </p>

  <p class="p">After processing a file or upon encountering errors, the origin can keep, archive, or delete
            the file. </p>

  <p class="p">When the pipeline stops, the Amazon S3 origin notes where it stops reading. When the pipeline
   starts again, the origin continues processing from where it stopped by default. You can reset the
   origin to process all requested files. </p>

        <p class="p">You can optionally use a proxy to connect to Amazon S3. </p>

<div class="topic concept nested1" id="concept_elk_jr4_ht">
 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Folder and File Name Pattern</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Amazon S3 origin processes files based on the user-defined location and pattern of
        the file name to be read. You can process files in a single folder or a set of folders. To
        define a set of folders, include a directory in the file name pattern and use wildcards to
        define a glob pattern.</p>

        <p class="p">Note that the origin does not process files recursively in unspecified subdirectories. It
            processes files in the specified folder or directories defined by a glob pattern. </p>

  <p class="p">For example, to read all CSV files in the East Coast folder, you can use "East Coast" for the
            folder name and "*.csv" for the file name pattern. </p>

        <p class="p">But say the East Coast folder includes a separate subdirectory for each state. To read
            all CSV files for each state, you can leave the folder property empty, and then use the
            following for the file name pattern: "East Coast/*/*.csv". </p>

        <p class="p">With this configuration, the Amazon S3 origin processes all CSV files in the first level
            of East Coast subdirectories. The origin does not process any CSV files in the East
            Coast folder or in folders nested in the subdirectories.</p>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">File Processing Order</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Amazon S3 origin processes files that match the configured file name pattern in
                order of the last-modified timestamp.</p>

                <p class="p">When you start a pipeline, the Amazon S3
                        origin starts processing data with the earliest file in the defined location
                        that matches the user-defined file name pattern, and then progresses in
                        chronological order. If two or more files have the same timestamp, the
                        origin processes the files in lexicographically increasing order.</p>

                <p class="p">To process files that include a timestamp earlier than processed files, reset the
                        origin to read all available files.</p>

                <p class="p">For example, you use "*.log" as the file name pattern to process the following
                        log files from two different servers:</p>

                <pre class="pre codeblock">fileA.log        09-30-2015 12:03:23
fileB.log        09-30-2015 15:34:51
file1.log        09-30-2015 12:00:00
file2.log        09-30-2015 18:39:44</pre>

                <div class="p">The origin reads these files in order of the timestamp, as
                        follows:<pre class="pre codeblock">file1.log        09-30-2015 12:00:00
fileA.log        09-30-2015 12:03:23
fileB.log        09-30-2015 15:34:51
file2.log        09-30-2015 18:39:44</pre>
</div>

                <p class="p">If while processing these files a new file arrives with a timestamp of 09-29-2015
                        12:00:00, the Amazon S3 origin cannot read the file unless you reset the
                        origin.</p>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Buffer Limit and Error Handling</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Amazon S3 origin uses a buffer to read files into memory to produce records. The
    size of the buffer determines the maximum size of the record that can be processed. </p>

  <p class="p">The buffer limit helps prevent out of memory errors.
      Decrease the buffer limit when memory on the <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> machine is
      limited. Increase the buffer limit to process larger records when memory is available. </p>

    <div class="p">When a record is larger than the specified limit, the origin processes the source file based
      on the stage error handling:<dl class="dl">
        
          <dt class="dt dlterm">Discard</dt>

          <dd class="dd">The origin discards the record and all remaining records in the file, and then
            continues processing the next file.</dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dt dlterm">Send to Error </dt>

          <dd class="dd">With a buffer limit error, the origin cannot send the record to the pipeline for error
            handling because it is unable to fully process the record. <p class="p">Instead, the origin sends
              a message to the Monitor console to indicate that a buffer overrun error occurred. The
              message includes the file and offset where the buffer overrun error occurred. The
              information displays in the pipeline history and displays as an alert when you monitor
              the pipeline. </p>
<p class="p">If an error directory is configured for the stage, the origin
              moves the file to the error directory and continues processing the next file.

        the broker. The origin functions as an MQTT client that receives messages, generating a
        record for each message.</p>

  <p class="p">When you configure the origin, you specify the
            information needed to connect to the MQTT broker. You must define connection credentials
            when the MQTT broker requires a user name and password. <span class="ph">You can also configure SSL/TLS properties, including default
                        transport protocols and cipher suites.</span></p>

        <p class="p">You specify one or more topics on the MQTT broker that the origin subscribes to.</p>

        <p class="p">You also configure the quality of service level and the persistence mechanism that the
            origin uses to enable reliable messaging. </p>

 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The MQTT Subscriber origin reads messages from one or more topics on the MQTT broker. A
        topic is a string that the broker uses to filter messages for each connected
        client.</p>

        <div class="p">When you configure the origin, you
            define one or more topic names. You can include multiple topic levels in a topic. For
            example, the following topic has three topic
            levels:<pre class="pre codeblock">sales/US/NorthernRegion</pre>
</div>

        <p class="p">You can use the StreamSets expression language to define the topic names. You can also

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Multithreaded Processing</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">The Kinesis
            Consumer origin can perform parallel processing and enables the creation of a
            multithreaded pipeline. The origin uses multiple concurrent threads based on the Max
            Threads property.</p>

        <p class="p">When you start the pipeline, <span class="ph">each thread connects to the origin system
                        and creates a batch of data, and passes the batch to an available pipeline
                        runner. A pipeline runner is a <dfn class="term">sourceless pipeline instance</dfn> -
                        an instance of the pipeline that includes all of the processors and
                        destinations in the pipeline and performs all pipeline processing after the
                        origin.</span></p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph"> Each pipeline runner processes one batch at a time,
                        just like a pipeline that runs on a single thread. When the flow of data
                        slows, the pipeline runners wait idly until they are needed.</span></p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph">Multithreaded pipelines preserve the order of
                        records within each batch, just like a single-threaded pipeline. But since
                        batches are processed by different pipeline instances, the order that
                        batches are written to destinations is not ensured.</span></p>

        <p class="p">For example, say you set the Max Threads property to 5. When you start the pipeline, <span class="ph">the origin creates five threads, and by default <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> creates a matching number of pipeline runners. Upon receiving data, the
                        origin passes a batch to each of the pipeline runners for processing.
                  </span>
        </p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph">Each pipeline runner performs the processing associated
                        with the rest of the pipeline. After a batch is written to pipeline
                        destinations, the pipeline runner becomes available for another batch of
                        data. Each batch is processed and written as quickly as possible,
                        independent from other batches processed by other pipeline runners, so
                        batches may be written differently from the read-order.</span></p>

        <p class="p">At any given moment, the five pipeline runners can each
                  process a batch, so this multithreaded pipeline processes up to five batches at a
                  time. When incoming data slows, the pipeline runners sit idle, available for use
                  as soon as the data flow increases.</p>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Read Interval</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can configure the read interval for the Kinesis Consumer. The read interval
  determines how long Kinesis Consumer waits before requesting additional data from Kinesis shards.
  By default, the Kinesis Consumer waits one second between requests. </p>

  <p class="p">Adjust the
   read interval to adapt to the Kinesis data load. For example, you might reduce the wait time to
   enable higher throughput or increase the wait time when the stream of data slows. </p>

  <p class="p">Amazon recommends 1 second read intervals. The minimum read interval for the Kinesis Consumer
            is 200 milliseconds which enables polling five times a second. To increase total

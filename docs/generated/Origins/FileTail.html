 <h1 class="title topictitle1">File Tail</h1>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The File Tail origin reads lines of data as they are written to an active file after
        reading related archived files in the same directory. File Tail generates a record for each
        line of data.</p>

        <p class="p">When you configure File Tail, you define the full
            path to the active file, the naming convention for archived files, and the first
            archived file to process. These properties determine the set of files that are read and
            the order of processing.</p>

        <p class="p">For example, a File Tail is configured to tail a log called server.log, starting with
            server.log.1, expecting archived files named in reverse counter order. When the pipeline
            runs, it starts reading lines from the beginning of server.log.1, ignoring older files.
            When it reaches the end of server.log.1, it continues processing data in server.log.
            When it completes reading existing data in server.log, it tails incoming data for the
            file.</p>

        <p class="p">When you stop a pipeline, File Tail notes where it stops reading. When you restart the
            pipeline, File Tail continues processing from the line where it left off, even if it has
            been archived to a different file. </p>

        <p class="p">You can reset the origin for File Tail. When you reset the origin, the File Tail treats
            all properties as if you are starting the pipeline for the first time - processing all
            requested files before continuing to the active file. </p>

        <p class="p">File Tail includes record header attributes that enable you to use the origins of a
            record in pipeline processing. </p>

        <p class="p">The origin can also generate events for an event
                  stream. For more information about dataflow triggers and the event framework, see
                        <a class="xref" href="../Event_Handling/EventFramework-Title.html#concept_cph_5h4_lx">Dataflow Triggers Overview</a>. </p>

        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you use logrotate with the copytruncate option, use the Directory origin to process

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">File Processing and Archive File Names</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">File Tail processes the active file and archived files based on how the source server
    generates files. When you specify the naming convention for archived files, File Tail determines
    the file generation method and processes the data accordingly.</p>

  <div class="p">File Tail can process data based on the following common file
      generation and archive strategies:<dl class="dl">
        
          <dt class="dt dlterm">The server writes data to a single active file and generates archive files as
            needed</dt>

          <dd class="dd">The server writes new data to a single file, such as weblog.log. Periodically, it
            rolls older data from the active file to an archive file, such as weblog.log1 or
            weblog.log.2015-10-15. </dd>

          <dd class="dd">File Tail intelligently tracks its relative progress through new and archived data and
            is not affected by file name changes.</dd>

          <dd class="dd">File Tail can process archived files that use the following naming conventions:<ul class="ul" id="concept_trt_thq_5r__ul_ury_gzq_5r">
              <li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Active File with Reverse Counter</span> - The server appends a

                end of the archived file, such as event.log.2015-11, event.log.2015-12. This method
                is generally used by Log4j servers. File Tail provides a set of available date
                patterns. If the date pattern of your log files is not available, you might use
                  Alphabetical.<p class="p">File Tail processes files in reverse order based on the selected

                in alphabetically increasing order, such as file.json.a, file.json.b, file.json.c.
                You might use this method to process Apache logs archived with the logrotate
                utility. You can also use Alphabetical to process files with appended dates that do
                not match the provided date patterns.<p class="p">File Tail processes files in alphabetical
                  order before progressing to the active file.</p>

            renaming</dt>

          <dd class="dd">The server writes to an active file, creating a new active file as necessary. When it
            creates a new active file, it archives the previous active file without renaming it. The
            active file changes, but file names do not change. </dd>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Multiple Paths and File Sets</h2>

    
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">File Tail can read sets of files in different directories. When File Tail processes
        different sets of files, it merges all data in the pipeline. If you need to separate the
        records later, you can use the tag record attribute.</p>

  <p class="p">To define a set of files to be processed, you specify
            the full path to an active file and related properties. You can define additional file
            sets by configuring a set of properties for each set of files.</p>

        <div class="p">You can also use wildcards to define glob patterns in the path definition to represent
            multiple paths and active files. When you define glob patterns, note the following
                restrictions:<ul class="ul" id="concept_cyz_kr4_1s__ul_cgm_4vx_mv">
                <li class="li">The part of the path before wildcards must exist when the pipeline starts unless
                    you enable the origin to read from late directories. Use the Allow Late
                    Directories property to allow reading from late directories.<div class="p">For example,
                        without late directories enabled, the /server/ part of the following
                        directory must exist when you start the pipeline.
                        <pre class="pre codeblock">/server/*/activity.log</pre>
</div>
</li>

                <li class="li">While you can use multiple wildcards in a path, do not use multiple wildcards in
                    a row.<div class="p">For example, this path is
                        valid:<pre class="pre codeblock">/user/*/logs/*/log-*.json</pre>
</div>
<p class="p">But the
                        following path does not pass validation because it includes two adjacent

  <p class="p">Configure a first file
            for processing when you want the File Tail origin to ignore one or more existing files
            in the directory.</p>

        <p class="p">When you define a first file to process, File Tail starts processing with the specified
            file and continues based on the selected naming convention for archived files. When you
            do not specify a first file, the origin processes all files in the directory based on
            the naming convention.</p>

        <div class="p">For example, say the origin reads an active file with reverse counter archived files. To
            ignore all files older than a particular file, use that file as the first file to
                process.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> When you restart a stopped pipeline, File Tail ignores this property.

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Late Directories</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can configure File Tail to read files in late directories - directories that appear
        after the pipeline starts. </p>

        <p class="p">When reading from late directories, File Tail does
            not validate the directory path when you start the pipeline. If no valid directories
            exist when the pipeline starts, File Tail waits indefinitely for the appearance of a
            valid directory and a file to tail.</p>

        <p class="p">For example, say you want to tail the following files:</p>

        <div class="p">
            <pre class="pre codeblock">/logs/*/server/*/log.json</pre>

        </div>

        <p class="p">No valid directory or file exists when you start the pipeline, so File Tail waits until a
            valid directory and file appears before tailing the file. </p>

        <p class="p">This file path allows the origin to tail the files in the following late-arriving
            directories:</p>

        <pre class="pre codeblock">/logs/region1/server/8/log.json
/logs/region2/server/15/log.json

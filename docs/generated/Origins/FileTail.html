 <h1 class="title topictitle1">File Tail</h1>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The File Tail origin reads lines of data as they are written to an active file after
        reading related archived files in the same directory. File Tail generates a record for each
        line of data.</p>

        <p class="p">When you configure File Tail, you define the full
            path to the active file, the naming convention for archived files, and the first
            archived file to process. These properties determine the set of files that are read and
            the order of processing.</p>

        <p class="p">For example, a File Tail is configured to tail a log called server.log, starting with
            server.log.1, expecting archived files named in reverse counter order. When the pipeline
            runs, it starts reading lines from the beginning of server.log.1, ignoring older files.
            When it reaches the end of server.log.1, it continues processing data in server.log.
            When it completes reading existing data in server.log, it tails incoming data for the
            file.</p>

        <p class="p">When you stop a pipeline, File Tail notes where it stops reading. When you restart the
            pipeline, File Tail continues processing from the line where it left off, even if it has
            been archived to a different file. </p>

        <p class="p">You can reset the origin for File Tail. When you reset the origin, the File Tail treats
            all properties as if you are starting the pipeline for the first time - processing all
            requested files before continuing to the active file. </p>

        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you use logrotate with the copytruncate option, use the Directory origin to process
            the rolled or archived files. File Tail does not support copytruncate.</div>

        <p class="p">File Tail includes additional header attributes that enable you to include the provenance
            of a record in the record. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="Origins_overview.html#concept_ljn_2h3_yv" title="The Directory, File Tail, and Kafka Consumer origins include record header attributes for each record.

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">File Processing and Archived File Names</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">File Tail processes the active file and archived files based on how the source server
  generates files. When you specify the naming convention for archived files, File Tail determines
  the file generation method and processes the data accordingly.</p>

  <div class="p">File Tail can process data based on the following common file
   generation and archive strategies:<dl class="dl">
    
     <dt class="dt dlterm">The server writes data to a single active file and generates archive files as needed</dt>

     <dd class="dd">The server writes new data to a single file, such as weblog.log. Periodically, it rolls
      older data from the active file to an archive file, such as weblog.log1 or
      weblog.log.2015-10-15. </dd>

     <dd class="dd">File Tail intelligently tracks its relative progress through new and archived data and is
      not affected by file name changes.</dd>

     <dd class="dd">File Tail can process archived files that use the following naming conventions:<ul class="ul" id="concept_trt_thq_5r__ul_ury_gzq_5r">
              <li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Active File with Reverse Counter</span> - The server appends a

                  Tail processes files in reverse numeric order before progressing to the active
                  file.</p>
</li>

              <li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Active File with Date</span> - The server appends a date to the
                end of the archived file, such as event.log.2015-11, event.log.2015-12. This method
                is generally used by Log4j servers. File Tail provides a set of available date
                patterns. If the date pattern of your log files is not available, you might use
                  Alphabetical.<p class="p">File Tail processes files in reverse order based on the selected

</li>

              <li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Active File with Alphabetical</span> - The server generates files
                in alphabetically increasing order, such as file.json.a, file.json.b, file.json.c.
                You might use this method to process Apache logs archived with the logrotate
                utility. You can also use Alphabetical to process files with appended dates that do
                not match the provided date patterns.<p class="p">File Tail processes files in alphabetical
                  order before progressing to the active file.</p>

</dd>

    
    
     <dt class="dt dlterm">The server writes a new active file as needed, archiving the previous file without
            renaming</dt>

     <dd class="dd">The server writes to an active file, creating a new active file as necessary. When it
      creates a new active file, it archives the previous active file without renaming it. The
      active file changes, but file names do not change. </dd>

     <dd class="dd">The server generates files using a pattern that you can define with a regular expression. </dd>

     <dd class="dd">Use <span class="ph uicontrol">Files Matching a Pattern</span> as the archive file naming

     <dd class="dd">File Tail processes the files in alphabetical order before progressing to the most recent
      file - the active file. </dd>

     <dd class="dd">For example, if you use log_[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}\\.json as the file name pattern,
      File Tail might read log-2015-5-01.json, then log-2015-05-02.json, and so on - until it
      reaches the file for the current date.</dd>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Multiple Paths and File Sets</h2>

    
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">File Tail can read sets of files in different directories. When File Tail processes
        different sets of files, it merges all data in the pipeline. If you need to separate the
        records later, you can use the tag record attribute.</p>

  <p class="p">To define a set of files to be processed, you specify
            the full path to an active file and related properties. You can define additional file
            sets by configuring a set of properties for each set of files.</p>

        <div class="p">You can also use wildcards to define glob patterns in the path definition to represent
            multiple paths and active files. When you define glob patterns, note the following
                restrictions:<ul class="ul" id="concept_cyz_kr4_1s__ul_cgm_4vx_mv">
                <li class="li">The part of the path before wildcards must exist when the pipeline starts unless
                    you enable the origin to read from late directories. Use the Allow Late
                    Directories property to allow reading from late directories.<div class="p">For example,
                        without late directories enabled, the /server/ part of the following
                        directory must exist when you start the pipeline.
                        <pre class="pre codeblock">/server/*/activity.log</pre>
</div>
</li>

                <li class="li">While you can use multiple wildcards in a path, do not use multiple wildcards in
                    a row.<div class="p">For example, this path is
                        valid:<pre class="pre codeblock">/user/*/logs/*/log-*.json</pre>
</div>
<p class="p">But the
                        following path does not pass validation because it includes two adjacent
                        wildcards:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock">/user/*/logs/*/*/log-*.json</pre>
</li>

            </ul>

</div>
<div class="topic concept nested1" id="concept_xcd_dxw_mv">
 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Late Directories</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can configure File Tail to read files in late directories - directories that appear
        after the pipeline starts. </p>

        <p class="p">When reading from late directories, File Tail does
            not validate the directory path when you start the pipeline. If no valid directories
            exist when the pipeline starts, File Tail waits indefinitely for the appearance of a
            valid directory and a file to tail.</p>

        <p class="p">For example, say you want to tail the following files:</p>

        <div class="p">
            <pre class="pre codeblock">/logs/*/server/*/log.json</pre>

        </div>

        <p class="p">No valid directory or file exists when you start the pipeline, so File Tail waits until a
            valid directory and file appears before tailing the file. </p>

        <p class="p">This file path allows the origin to tail the files in the following late-arriving
            directories:</p>

        <pre class="pre codeblock">/logs/region1/server/8/log.json
/logs/region2/server/15/log.json

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">When you use the Files Matching a Pattern naming option, use the
   PATTERN constant as a placeholder for the file name pattern. Then you use the Pattern property to
   define the PATTERN constant. </p>

  <p class="p">For example, the following properties process data in files named
   weblog_&lt;yyyy&gt;-&lt;mm&gt;-&lt;dd&gt;.json and add a "webservers" tag attribute to each record:</p>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Defining and Using a Tag</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">A tag is an optional record attribute that you can define for sets of files. In the
  pipeline, you can use a function to return the value of the tag. </p>

  <p class="p">Define a tag so you
   can easily reference tagged records. You can define a tag for files specified by a path. Note
   that when you use wildcards or glob patterns in a path to represent several sets of files, those
   files would all use the same tag.</p>

  <div class="p">In the pipeline, you can use the following expression to return the tag
   attribute:<pre class="pre codeblock">record:attribute('tag')</pre>
</div>

  <div class="p">For example, when you use two different paths to tail files from two servers, you can tag the
   records ServerA and ServerB. In the Stream Selector, you can use the following conditions to
   separate the data to two different branches of the
   pipeline:<pre class="pre codeblock">${record:attribute('tag')='ServerA'}</pre>
<pre class="pre codeblock">${record:attribute('tag')='ServerB'}</pre>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Multiple Line Processing</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">File Tail can process log and text data that includes multiple lines. You might use
  multiple line processing to include stack traces with log data, or to process MySQL multiline
  logs. </p>

  <p class="p">To process multiline data, you use a regular expression to define
   the pattern of the standard line. When File Tail encounters data that does not match the pattern,
   it appends the non-matching data to the previous line. </p>

  <p class="p">Evaluating data for the pattern can impact performance, so use multiple line processing only

 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Elasticsearch origin is a multithreaded origin that reads data from an Elasticsearch
        cluster, including Elastic Cloud clusters (formerly Found clusters). The origin generates a
        record for each Elasticsearch document.</p>

        <p class="p">When
            you configure the Elasticsearch origin, you configure the HTTP URI used to connect to
            the Elasticsearch cluster and specify whether security is enabled on the cluster. You
            configure the origin to run in batch or incremental mode. </p>

        <p class="p">The origin uses the Elasticsearch scroll API to run a query that you define. A query can
            retrieve large numbers of documents from Elasticsearch. This allows the origin to run a
            single query and then read multiple batches of data from the scroll until no results are
            left. You configure a scroll timeout that defines the amount of time that the search
            context remains valid.</p>

        <p class="p">When the pipeline stops, the Elasticsearch origin notes where it stops reading. When the
            pipeline starts again, the origin continues processing from where it stopped - as long
            as the scroll timeout has not been exceeded or the origin is not configured to delete
            the scroll when the pipeline stops. You can reset the origin to process all requested
            documents.</p>

        <p class="p">When you configure the Elasticsearch origin, you specify the maximum number of slices to
            split the scroll into. The number of slices determines how many threads the origin uses
            to read the data.</p>

                <dd class="dd">In batch mode, the origin reads all data returned from the Elasticsearch query,
                    and then the pipeline stops. By default, the origin reads in batch mode. </dd>

        <dl class="dl">
            
                <dt class="dt dlterm">Incremental mode</dt>

                <dd class="dd">In incremental mode, the origin performs an initial read of all the data
                    returned from the Elasticsearch query, then the origin periodically runs the
                    query again to check for new data. In incremental mode, the pipeline runs
                    continuously so it can repeat the query at regular intervals. </dd>

                <dd class="dd">To use incremental mode, you define the amount of time that the origin waits
                    between queries, and you configure the offset field and initial offset value. </dd>

                <dd class="dd">The origin uses an offset field and initial offset value to determine where to
                    start reading data. By default, the offset field is defined as a field named
                        <samp class="ph systemoutput">timestamp</samp>. You can define any Elasticsearch
                    field as the offset field, though you'll most likely want to use a date field.
                    The initial offset value is a value within the offset field where you want the
                    Elasticsearch origin to start reading.</dd>

                <dd class="dd">Include both the offset field and the offset value in the Elasticsearch query. </dd>

                <dd class="dd">After the initial read, the origin saves the last read offset value. When the
                    origin runs the next incremental query, the origin uses the last read offset
                    value to continue processing from where it stopped. </dd>

  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}</pre>
</div>

        <p class="p">You can optionally specify an Elasticsearch index or mapping type to define the scope of
            the query in either batch or incremental mode. </p>

        <p class="p">For example, let's say that you specify the <samp class="ph codeph">customer</samp> index, do not
            specify a mapping type, configure the origin to use batch mode, and use the default
            query. The query properties are configured like so:</p>

 <h3 class="title topictitle3">Incremental Mode Query</h3>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">If you configure the origin to use incremental mode, you must include both the offset
        field and the offset value in the Elasticsearch query. Use <samp class="ph codeph">${OFFSET}</samp> to
        represent the offset value. </p>

        <p class="p">For example, let's say that you do not define an index or mapping type, configure the
            origin to use incremental mode, and configure the <samp class="ph codeph">timestamp</samp> field as
            the offset field. You use the Elasticsearch date math expression
                <samp class="ph codeph">now-1d/d</samp> to set the initial offset value to one day before the
            current time. You include the offset field and offset value in the query to determine
            where to start reading data. The query properties are configured like so:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_l5w_yhd_kz__image_cbs_btm_3z" src="../Graphics/Elasticsearch_IncrementalQuery.png" height="560" width="588" /></p>

        <p class="p">When you run the pipeline, the query returns all documents that have a timestamp field
            with a value greater than one day before the current time. The query sorts the results
            by timestamp.</p>

<div class="topic concept nested1" id="concept_jhw_ttm_3z">
 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Scroll Timeout</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">An Elasticsearch query can retrieve large numbers of documents from a single search
        request. This allows the Elasticsearch origin to run a single query, and then read multiple
        batches of data from the scroll until no results are left. An Elasticsearch scroll functions
        like a cursor in a traditional database.</p>

  <p class="p">To run an Elasticsearch query using the scroll
            API, you must set a scroll timeout. The scroll timeout tells Elasticsearch how long it
            should keep the search context alive. The scroll timeout must be long enough for a
            single batch to be fully read. When the origin reads another batch from the results, the
            scroll timeout is reset. </p>

        <p class="p">If the scroll timeout value is exceeded, Elasticsearch clears the scroll and the last
            saved offset, and the origin must run the query again. In batch mode, the origin reads
            all data returned from the query. In incremental mode, the origin begins reading from
            the initial offset configured for the origin.</p>

        <p class="p">Enter the scroll timeout using <a class="xref" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.2/common-options.html#time-units" target="_blank">Elasticsearch duration time units</a>. For
            example, enter <samp class="ph codeph">1m</samp> to set a one minute timeout, or enter
                <samp class="ph codeph">1h</samp> to set a one hour timeout.</p>

        <p class="p">Optionally, you can configure the origin to delete the scroll when the pipeline stops.
            When configured, <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
            clears the scroll as soon as the pipeline stops, rather than waiting for the scroll
            timeout value to be exceeded. Keeping a scroll window open consumes Elasticsearch
            resources. To free up those resources, configure the origin to clear the scroll when it
            is no longer being used.</p>

        <p class="p">Clearing the scroll also clears the last saved offset, and so is essentially like
            resetting the origin. When the pipeline continues, the origin processes all available
            data instead of processing data from the last saved offset.</p>

<div class="topic concept nested1" id="concept_ifs_wtm_3z">
 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Multithreaded Processing</h2>

 
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Elasticsearch origin performs parallel processing and enables the creation of a
        multithreaded pipeline. </p>

  <p class="p">The Elasticsearch
            origin uses multiple concurrent threads based on the Number of Slices property. <span class="ph">Each
                              thread connects to the origin system and creates a batch of data, and
                              passes the batch to an available pipeline runner.</span></p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph">A pipeline runner is a <dfn class="term">sourceless
                              pipeline instance</dfn> - an instance of the pipeline that includes
                        all of the processors and destinations in the pipeline and represents all
                        pipeline processing after the origin.</span>
            <span class="ph"> Each pipeline runner processes one batch at a time,
                        just like a pipeline that runs on a single thread. When the flow of data
                        slows, the pipeline runners wait idly until they are needed.</span></p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph">Multithreaded pipelines preserve the order of
                        records within each batch, just like a single-threaded pipeline. But since
                        batches are processed by different pipeline instances, the order that
                        batches are written to destinations is not ensured.</span></p>

        <p class="p">For example, the origin runs an Elasticsearch query that returns a large number of
            documents. To decrease processing time, you want to split the scroll into multiple
            slices and process each slice in parallel. You set the Number of Slices property to 5.
            When you start the pipeline, the origin splits the scroll into five slices, then <span class="ph"><span class="ph" id="concept_ifs_wtm_3z__d37034e2000">the origin creates five
                              threads, and by default <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> creates a matching number of pipeline runners.</span>
                        <span class="ph" id="concept_ifs_wtm_3z__d37034e2005">Upon receiving data, the origin passes a batch to
                              each of the pipeline runners for processing.</span>
                  </span></p>

        <p class="p">At any given moment, the five pipeline runners can each
                  process a batch, so this multithreaded pipeline processes up to five batches at a
                  time. When incoming data slows, the pipeline runners sit idle, available for use
                  as soon as the data flow increases.</p>

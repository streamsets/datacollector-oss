  <p class="p">The TCP Server origin listens at the specified
            port numbers, establishes TCP sessions with clients that initiate TCP connections, and
            then processes the incoming data.</p>

        <p class="p">The origin can operate in different modes. The modes determine the messages that it can
            process. It can process NetFlow messages or syslog messages. It can also process

            to the originating client after parsing each record or committing each batch. You can
            configure the origin to use multiple threads to improve performance when processing of
            large volumes of data. And on 64-bit Linux systems, you can enable native Epoll

        <p class="p">When you configure the TCP Server origin, you specify the ports to use and the TCP mode
            that indicates the type of data the origin will receive. Then you configure mode-related

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Multithreaded Processing</h2>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">The TCP Server origin
            performs parallel processing and enables the creation of a multithreaded pipeline. </p>

        <p class="p">When you enable multithreaded processing, the TCP Server origin uses multiple concurrent
            threads based on the Number of Receiver Threads property. When you start the pipeline,
            the origin creates the number of threads specified in the property. </p>

        <p class="p">As clients initiate TCP connections, the origin establishes TCP sessions and waits for
            data. Upon filling a batch, the origin passes the batch to an available pipeline runner. </p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph">A pipeline runner is a <dfn class="term">sourceless
                              pipeline instance</dfn> - an instance of the pipeline that includes
                        all of the processors and destinations in the pipeline and represents all
                        pipeline processing after the origin.</span>
            <span class="ph"> Each pipeline runner processes one batch at a time,
                        just like a pipeline that runs on a single thread. When the flow of data
                        slows, the pipeline runners wait idly until they are needed.</span></p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph">Multithreaded pipelines preserve the order of
                        records within each batch, just like a single-threaded pipeline. But since
                        batches are processed by different pipeline instances, the order that
                        batches are written to destinations is not ensured.</span></p>

        <p class="p">For example, say you enable multithreaded processing and set the Number of Receiver
            Threads property to 5. When you start the pipeline, <span class="ph"><span class="ph" id="concept_dcj_jc4_sz__d42523e2359">the origin creates five
                              threads, and <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> creates a matching number of pipeline runners.</span>
                        <span class="ph" id="concept_dcj_jc4_sz__d42523e2364">Upon receiving data, the origin passes a batch to
                              each of the pipeline runners for processing.</span>
                  </span>
        </p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph">Each pipeline runner performs the processing associated
                        with the rest of the pipeline. After a batch is written to pipeline
                        destinations, the pipeline runner becomes available for another batch of
                        data. Each batch is processed and written as quickly as possible,
                        independent from other batches processed by other pipeline runners, so
                        batches may be written differently from the read-order.</span></p>

        <p class="p">At any given moment, the five pipeline runners can each
                  process a batch, so this multithreaded pipeline processes up to five batches at a
                  time. When incoming data slows, the pipeline runners sit idle, available for use
                  as soon as the data flow increases.</p>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Closing Connections for Invalid Data</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">When the TCP
            Server origin receives invalid data, it closes the connection to the TCP client that
            sent the data. It also passes the data to the pipeline for error handling. </p>

        <p class="p">For example, when you configure the origin, you specify the maximum record size. When a
            TCP client sends a message that translates to larger than the maximum record size, the
            origin disconnects from the client and passes the message to the pipeline for error
            handling. </p>

        <p class="p">Similarly, say the TCP Server origin is configured to process XML data. If the origin
            receives an invalid XML document, it disconnects from the sending client and passes the
            data to the pipeline for error handling. </p>

            the pipeline, record, or batch in the message.</p>

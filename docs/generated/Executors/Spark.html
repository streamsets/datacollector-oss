            Spark executor starts a Spark application each time it receives an event. You can use
            the Spark executor with Spark on YARN or Spark on Databricks. The executor is not
            compatible with Spark on Mesos at this time. </p>

        <p class="p">Use the Spark executor to start a Spark application as part of an event stream. <span class="ph">You can use the executor in any logical way, such as running Spark
                        applications after the Hadoop FS, MapR FS, or Amazon S3 destination closes
                        files.</span> For
            example, you might use the executor to start a Spark application that converts Avro
            files to Parquet each time the Hadoop FS destination closes a file. </p>

        <p class="p">Note that the Spark executor starts an application in an external system. It does not
            monitor the application or wait for it to complete. The executor becomes available for
            additional processing as soon as it successfully submits an application. </p>

        <p class="p">When you configure the Spark executor, you specify the cluster manager used with Spark:
            YARN or Databricks. The cluster manager that you select determines the additional
            cluster manager properties, application details, and security options that you can
            configure. </p>

        <p class="p">Regardless of the cluster manager type, you can configure the executor to generate events
            for another event stream. <span class="ph">For more information about dataflow

  <p class="p">The Spark executor supports <span class="ph">Spark versions 1.3 through 2.1</span>. </p>

                <p class="p">For example, if you use Spark 2.1 to build the application, use a Spark executor
                    provided in one of the Spark 2.1 stage libraries. </p>

<span class="ph">For example, if your cluster uses Spark 1.6, use a

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Spark on YARN</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">When using the
            Spark executor with YARN, the executor can run the application in client or cluster
            mode. Run the application in client mode only when resource use is not a concern.</p>

        <p class="p">When you configure the Spark executor, you can specify the number of worker nodes Spark
            should use, or you can enable dynamic allocation and specify the minimum and maximum
            number of worker nodes. Dynamic allocation allows Spark to use additional worker nodes as
            needed, within the specified range.</p>

        <p class="p">You can specify additional cluster manager properties to pass to Spark, such as the
            maximum amount of memory that the application driver and executor can use.</p>

        <p class="p">You can also configure additional Spark arguments and environment variables. Any
            arguments and variables that you enter override any previous definitions, including
            those in the Spark application, elsewhere in the Spark executor, and the <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
            machine.</p>

        <p class="p">You can specify custom Spark and Java home directories, and a Hadoop proxy user. You can
            also enter Kerberos credentials if needed.</p>

        <p class="p">When you configure the application details, you specify the language used to write the

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">The Spark executor can generate events that you
            can use in an event stream. When you enable event generation, the executor generates
            events each time it starts a Spark application. </p>

        <div class="p">Spark executor events can be used in any logical way. For example: <ul class="ul" id="concept_xmx_1wg_gz__ul_dzf_tpg_zx">
                <li class="li">With the Email executor to send a custom email
                              after receiving an event.<p class="p">For an example, see <a class="xref" href="../Event_Handling/EventFramework-Title.html#concept_t2t_lp5_xz">Case Study: Sending Email</a>.</p>
</li>

                <li class="li">With a destination to store event information.

</li>

            </ul>

        <p class="p">Since Spark executor events include the application ID for each application that it

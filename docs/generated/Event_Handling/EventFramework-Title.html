    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p"><dfn class="term">Dataflow
                triggers</dfn> are instructions for the event framework to kick off tasks in
            response to events that occur in the pipeline. For example, you can use dataflow
            triggers to start a MapReduce job after the pipeline writes a file to HDFS. Or you might
            use a dataflow trigger to stop a pipeline after the JDBC Query Consumer origin processes
            all available data. </p>

        <div class="p">The event framework consist of the following components:<dl class="dl">
                
                    <dt class="dt dlterm">event generation</dt>

                    <dd class="dd">The event framework generates pipeline-related events and stage-related
                        events. The framework generates pipeline events only when the pipeline
                        starts and stops. The framework generates stage events when specific
                        stage-related actions take place. The action that generates an event differs
                        from stage to stage and is related to how the stage processes data. </dd>

                    <dd class="dd">For example, the Hive Metastore destination updates the Hive metastore, so
                        it generates events each time it changes the metastore. In contrast, the
                        Hadoop FS destination writes files to HDFS, so it generates events each time
                        it closes a file. </dd>

                    <dd class="dd">Events produce <dfn class="term">event records</dfn>. Pipeline-related event records
                        are passed immediately to the specified event consumer. Stage-related event
                        records are passed through the pipeline in an <dfn class="term">event stream</dfn>. </dd>

                
                
                    <dt class="dt dlterm">task execution</dt>

                    <dd class="dd">To trigger a task, you need an <dfn class="term">executor</dfn>. Executor stages
                        perform tasks in <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> or external systems. Each time an executor receives an event, it performs
                        the specified task.</dd>

                    <dd class="dd">For example, the Hive Query executor runs user-defined Hive or Impala
                        queries each time it receives an event, and the MapReduce executor triggers
                        a MapReduce job when it receives events. Within <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>, the Pipeline Finisher executor stops a pipeline upon receiving an event,
                        transitioning the pipeline to a Finished state. </dd>

                
                
                    <dt class="dt dlterm">event storage</dt>

                    <dd class="dd">To store event information, pass the event to a destination. The destination
                        writes the event records to the destination system, just like any other
                        data.</dd>

                    <dd class="dd">For example, you might store event records to keep an audit trail of the
                        files that the pipeline origin reads. </dd>

    <h2 class="title topictitle2">Pipeline Event Generation</h2>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">The event
            framework generates pipeline events at specific points in the pipeline lifecycle. You
            can configure the pipeline properties to pass each event to an executor or to another
            pipeline for more complex processing.</p>

        <div class="p">The event framework generates the following pipeline-related events:<dl class="dl">
                
                    <dt class="dt dlterm">Pipeline Start</dt>

                    <dd class="dd">The pipeline start event is generated <span class="ph">as the pipeline initializes, immediately after it starts and
                        before individual stages are initialized</span>. This can allow time for an executor to perform a task before stages
                        initialize. </dd>

                    <dd class="dd">Most executors wait for confirmation that a task completes. As a result, the
                        pipeline waits for the executor to complete the task before continuing with
                        stage initialization. For example, if you configure the JDBC Query executor
                        to truncate a table before the pipeline begins, the pipeline waits until the
                        task is complete before processing any data. </dd>

                    <dd class="dd">
                        <p class="p">The MapReduce executor and Spark executor kick off jobs and do not wait
                            for the submitted jobs to complete. When you use one of these executors,
                            the pipeline waits only for successful job submission before continuing
                            with stage initialization.</p>

                        <p class="p">If the executor fails to process the event, for example if a Hive Query
                            Executor fails to execute the specified query or if the query fails,
                            then the initialization phase fails and the pipeline does not start.
                            Instead the pipeline transitions to a failure state.</p>

                    </dd>

                
                
                    <dt class="dt dlterm">Pipeline Stop</dt>

                    <dd class="dd">The pipeline stop event is generated <span class="ph">as the pipeline stops, either manually, programmatically, or due
                        to a failure. The stop event is generated after all stages have completed
                        processing and cleaning up temporary resources, such as removing temporary
                        files.</span> This allows an executor to perform a task after pipeline processing is
                        complete, before the pipeline fully stops.</dd>

                    <dd class="dd">
                        <p class="p">Similar to start event consumers, the behavior of the executor that
                            consumes the event determines whether the pipeline waits for the
                            executor task to complete before allowing the pipeline to stop. Also, if
                            the processing of the pipeline stop event fails for any reason, the
                            pipeline transitions to a failed state even though the data processing
                            was successful.</p>

 <h4 class="title topictitle4">Pass to an Executor</h4>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">You can
            configure a pipeline to pass each event type to an executor stage. This allows you to
            trigger a task when the pipeline starts or stops. You configure the behavior for each
            event type separately. And you can discard any event that you do not want to use.</p>

 <h4 class="title topictitle4">Pass to Another Pipeline</h4>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">Pass
            pipeline events to another pipeline to perform more complex processing than simply
            passing the event to a single consumer. The event-consuming pipeline must use the SDC
            RPC origin, then can include as many other stages as you require. </p>

        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> When you pass a pipeline event to another pipeline, the event-consuming pipeline does
            not report processing failures back to the event-generating pipeline automatically. For
            example, if you pass a pipeline event to a pipeline that has an executor that fails to
            complete its task, the failure is not reported back to the event-generating
            pipeline.</div>

        <p class="p">To achieve the same behavior as passing to an executor, where a processing failure causes
            the event-generating pipeline to fail, configure the relevant stages to stop the
            event-consuming pipeline upon error. Upon error, the event-consuming pipeline then stops
            and passes the message back to the event-generating pipeline, which then transitions to
            a failure state.</p>

        <p class="p">For example, say you pass a pipeline event to a pipeline that routes the event to two
            executors. To ensure that the event-generating pipeline fails if either of the executors
            fail, configure the On Record Error property on the General tab of both executors,
            setting the property to Stop Pipeline. </p>

        <p class="p">This causes the event-consuming pipeline to stop on error, which causes the

 <h3 class="title topictitle3">Using Stage Events</h3>

 <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">You can use
            stage-related events in any way that suits your needs. When configuring the event stream
            for stage events, you can add additional stages to the stream. For example, you might
            use a Stream Selector to route different types of events to different executors. But you
            cannot merge the event stream with a data stream. </p>

        <div class="p">There are two general types of event streams that you might create: <ul class="ul" id="concept_sjr_nrx_4x__ul_pr4_qz2_zx">
                <li class="li">Task execution streams that route events to an executor to perform a task. </li>

                <li class="li">Event storage streams that route events to a destination to store event
                    information.</li>

            </ul>
You can, of course, configure an event stream that performs both tasks by routing
            event records to both an executor and a destination. You can also configure event
            streams to route data to multiple executors and destinations, as needed.</div>

 </div>

<div class="topic concept nested3" id="concept_ivh_xy2_zx">
 <h4 class="title topictitle4">Task Execution Streams</h4>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">A task execution stream
            routes event records from the event-generating stage to an executor stage. The executor
            performs a task each time it receives an event record. </p>

        <p class="p">For example, you have a pipeline that reads from Kafka and writes files to HDFS:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_ivh_xy2_zx__image_b5z_25q_tx" src="../Graphics/Event-ParquetBasicPipe.png" height="81" width="581" /></p>

        <p class="p">When Hadoop FS closes a file, you would like the file moved to a different directory and
            the file permissions changed to read-only. </p>

        <p class="p">Leaving the rest of the pipeline as is, you can enable event handling in the Hadoop FS
            destination, connect it to the HDFS File Metadata executor, and configure the HDFS File
            Metadata executor to files and change permissions. The resulting pipeline looks like
            this:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_ivh_xy2_zx__image_c5z_25q_tx" src="../Graphics/Event-EventPipe.png" height="150" width="635" /></p>

        <p class="p">If you needed to set permissions differently based on the file name or location, you
            could use a Stream Selector to route the event records accordingly, then use two HDFS
            File Metadata executors to alter file permissions, as follows:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_ivh_xy2_zx__image_os2_nqf_zx" src="../Graphics/Event-EventPipe-SSelector.png" height="160" width="639" /></p>

<div class="topic concept nested3" id="concept_bfd_31f_zx">
 <h4 class="title topictitle4">Event Storage Streams</h4>

 <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">An event storage stream routes event records from the
            event-generating stage to a destination. The destination writes the event record to a
            destination system.</p>

        <p class="p">Event records include information about the event in record header attributes and record
            fields. You can add processors to the event stream to enrich the event record before
            writing it to the destination. </p>

        <p class="p">For example, you have a pipeline that uses the Directory origin to process weblogs:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_bfd_31f_zx__image_g5w_m1f_zx" src="../Graphics/Event-Directory.png" height="98" width="637" /></p>

        <p class="p">Directory generates event records each time it starts and completes reading a file, and
            the event record includes a field with the file path of the file. For auditing purposes,
            you'd like to write this information to a database table.</p>

        <p class="p">Leaving the rest of the pipeline as is, you can enable event handling for the Directory
            origin and simply connect it to the JDBC Producer as follows:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_bfd_31f_zx__image_d2y_1vq_tx" src="../Graphics/Event-Directory-JDBC.png" height="166" width="540" /></p>

        <div class="p">But you want to know when events occur. The Directory event record stores the event
            creation time in the sdc.event.creation_timestamp record header attribute. So you can
            use an Expression Evaluator with the following expression to add the creation date and
            time to the record:
            <pre class="pre codeblock">${record:attribute('sdc.event.creation_timestamp')}</pre>
</div>

        <div class="p">And if you have multiple pipelines writing events to the same location, you can use the
            following expression to include the pipeline name in the event record as
            well:<pre class="pre codeblock">${pipeline:name()}</pre>
</div>

        <p class="p">The Expression Evaluator and the final pipeline looks like this:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_bfd_31f_zx__image_e2y_1vq_tx" src="../Graphics/Event-Directory-ExpJDBC.png" height="328" width="572" /></p>

                <li class="li">We also need to add an event stream to the Hadoop FS destination so we can run
                    the Invalidate Metadata command each time the destination writes a file to Hive.

                <li class="li">The event record generated by the Hadoop FS destination does not include the
                    table name required by the Hive Query executor, but it contains the table name
                    in the file path. So add an Expression Evaluator processor to the event stream.
                    Create a new Table field and use the following
                        expression:<pre class="pre codeblock"><span class="ph" id="concept_szz_xwm_lx__d29129e4033">`${file:pathElement(record:value('/filepath'), -3)}`.`${file:pathElement(record:value('/filepath'), -2)}`</span></pre>
<div class="p">This
                        expression uses the path in the Filepath field of the event record and
                        performs the following calculations:<ul class="ul" id="concept_szz_xwm_lx__ul_umt_2sm_5x">
                            <li class="li">Extracts the third-to-last section of the path and uses it as the

                            <li class="li">Extracts the second-to-last section of the path and uses it as the

                        </ul>
</div>
<p class="p">So when Hadoop FS completes a file, it writes the path of the
                        written file in the filepath field, such as users/logs/server1weblog.txt.
                        And the expression above properly interprets the database and table name as:
                        logs.server1weblog.</p>

    <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">By default, the Hadoop FS destination creates a
            complex set of directories for output files and late record files, keeping files open
            for writing based on stage configuration. That's great, but once the files are complete,
            you'd like the files moved to a different location. And while you're at it, it would be
            nice to set the permissions for the written files. </p>

        <p class="p">So what do you do? </p>

        <div class="p">Add an event stream to the pipeline to manage output files when the Hadoop FS destination
            is done writing them. Then, use the HDFS File Metadata executor in the event
                stream.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you prefer, instead of using the Hadoop FS destination with the HDFS
                File Metadata executor, you can use the Local FS destination with the HDFS File

                executor.</div>
</div>

        <p class="p">Here's a pipeline that reads from a database using JDBC, performs some processing, and

        <ol class="ol" id="concept_d1q_xl4_lx__ol_fvh_5m4_lx">
            <li class="li">To add an event stream, first configure Hadoop FS to generate events:<p class="p">On the

<p class="p">Now, the event output
                    stream becomes available, and Hadoop FS generates an event record each time it

            <li class="li">Connect the Hadoop FS event output stream to a HDFS File Metadata executor.<p class="p">Now,

            <li class="li">Configure the HDFS File Metadata executor to move the files to the directory that

<p class="p">In this case, you want to move files to

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">Say your dataflow topology updates a database table
            daily at 4 am. Rather than have the pipeline process the data in a few minutes and sit
            idle for the rest of the day, you want to kick off the pipeline, have it process all

</div>

        <p class="p">We'll use the JDBC Query Consumer to show a more complex scenario. </p>

        <p class="p">Here's the basic pipeline that reads from a database, performs some processing, and

<p class="p">The JDBC Query Consumer
                        generates several types of events: query success, query failure, and
                        no-more-data. We know this because you checked the <a class="xref" href="../Origins/JDBCConsumer.html#concept_rzl_s1t_kz">Event
                            Record section</a> of the JDBC Query Consumer documentation. Every
                        event-generating stage has event details in a similar section. </p>
<p class="p">The
                        query success and failure events can be useful, so you might use a Stream
                        Selector to route those records to a separate event stream. But let's say we
                        don't care about those events, we just want the no-more-data event to pass
                        to the Pipeline Finisher executor. </p>
</li>

                <li class="li">Connect the event output stream to the Pipeline Finisher executor. <p class="p">At this
                        point, all events that the origin generates come to the executor. Since the
                        JDBC Query Consumer origin generates multiple event types, this setup might
                        cause the executor to stop the pipeline too soon.</p>
</li>

                <li class="li">To ensure that only the no-more-data event enters the executor, configure a
                        precondition.<p class="p">With a precondition, only records that meet the specified
                        condition can enter the stage. </p>
<p class="p">We know that each event record
                        includes the event type in the sdc.event.type record header attribute. So to
                        ensure that only no-more-data events enter the stage, we can use the
                        following expression in the
                    precondition:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock">${record:eventType() == 'no-more-data'}</pre>
</li>

                <li class="li">Records that don't meet the precondition go to the stage for error handling, so
                    to avoid storing error records that we don't care about – that is, the query
                    success and failure events – let's also set the <span class="ph uicontrol">On Record
                        Error</span> property to <span class="ph uicontrol">Discard</span>.<p class="p">So here's

</li>

                <li class="li">Now, to get notified when the Pipeline Finisher stops the pipeline, configure
                    the pipeline to send an email when the pipeline state changes to Finished.
                        <div class="p">You can use this option when <span class="ph">Data

That's it!</div>

        <p class="p">With this setup, the JDBC Query Consumer passes a no-more-data event when it completes
            processing all data returned by the query, and the Pipeline Finisher executor stops the
            pipeline and transitions the pipeline to a Finished state. All other events generated by
            the origin are discarded. <span class="ph">Data

            sends notification so you know when the pipeline finishes, and the next time you want to

                        want to use generates additional event types, you should ensure that only
                        the no-more-data event is routed to the Pipeline Finisher. For details, see

                        properties.</p>
<p class="p">Also note that you can pass each type of pipeline event to

<p class="p">Also,

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Case Study: Sending Email</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">You can configure
            a pipeline to send email upon <a class="xref" href="../Pipeline_Configuration/PipelineConfiguration_title.html#concept_mtn_k4j_rz">pipeline
                state change</a> and upon <a class="xref" href="../Alerts/RulesAlerts_title.html#task_f3v_1hw_1r" title="You can define the email addresses to receive metric and data alerts.

            use an Email executor to send email upon receiving an event. </p>

        <p class="p">Say you have a pipeline that reads from a database using the JDBC Query Consumer origin,
            uses a Jython Evaluator to evaluate the data and generate events for invalid
            transactions, and writes to HDFS. You want this pipeline to send two types of email: one
            when the Jython Evaluator finds an invalid transaction and one when the JDBC Query
            Consumer fails to complete a query. </p>

        <p class="p">To do this, you simply route the events from the origin and processor to the Email
            executor and configure two email messages. The Email executor allows you to specify a
            condition for sending email and to use expressions to create customized email that
            provides event-related information to the recipient.</p>

        <p class="p">Say this is the original pipeline:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_t2t_lp5_xz__image_b4k_htw_xz" src="../Graphics/Event-Email-Pipe.png" height="78" width="497" /></p>

<p class="p">Now, the event
                        output stream becomes available. Note that the JDBC Query Consumer generates
                        several types of events. You know this because you checked the <a class="xref" href="../Origins/JDBCConsumer.html#concept_rzl_s1t_kz">Event

</li>

                <li class="li">Now configure the Jython Evaluator to generate events in the same way.<p class="p">Of
                        course, the Jython Evaluator will only generate events if your script is set
                        up to do so. But you also need to enable the <span class="ph uicontrol">Produce

                    list of event-generating stages, see <a class="xref" href="EventFramework-Title.html#concept_zrl_mhn_lx">Stage Event Generation</a>.</li>

                <li class="li">Events generate <dfn class="term">event records</dfn> to pass relevant information
                    regarding the event, such as the path to the file that was closed. <p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph" id="concept_azz_tq4_lx__d29129e3838">Stage-generated event records
                              differ from stage to stage.</span> For a description of stage events,
                        see "Event Record" in the documentation for the event-generating stage. For
                        a description of pipeline events, see <a class="xref" href="../Pipeline_Configuration/PipelineConfiguration_title.html#concept_cv3_nqt_51b">Pipeline Event Records</a>.</span>
                    </p>
</li>

                <li class="li">In the simplest use case, you can route stage event records to a destination to
                    save event information.</li>

                <li class="li">To trigger a task with an event, use an executor stage. <p class="p">For a list of logical
                        event generation and executor pairings, see <a class="xref" href="EventFramework-Title.html#concept_scs_3hh_tx">Logical Pairings</a>.</p>
</li>

                <li class="li">You can add processors to event streams for stage events or to consuming
                    pipelines for pipeline events.<p class="p">For example, you might add an Expression
                        Evaluator to add the event generation time to an event record before writing
                        it to a destination. Or, you might use a Stream Selector to route different
                        types of event records to different executors.</p>
</li>

                <li class="li">When working with stage events, you cannot merge event streams with data
                    streams. </li>

                <li class="li">You can use the Dev Data Generator and To Event development stages to generate
                    events for pipeline development and testing. For more information about the
                    development stages, see <a class="xref" href="../Pipeline_Design/DevStages.html#concept_czx_ktn_ht">Development Stages</a>.</li>

                <li class="li">In data preview and in Monitor mode, stage-generated event records display
                    separately in the event-generating stage. Afterwards, they are treated like any
                    standard record. </li>

                <li class="li">You can configure data preview to generate and execute pipeline events.</li>

            </ol>
 For examples of how you might use the event framework, see the case studies
            earlier in this chapter. </div>

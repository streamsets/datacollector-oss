 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Standalone Pipelines</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">When used in a standalone pipeline, the Spark
            Evaluator processor starts a local Spark application. It passes a batch of data to the
            Spark application as a Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD). The Spark application - or
                <samp class="ph codeph">SparkContext</samp> - runs as long as the pipeline runs. The Spark
            application submits jobs to the StreamSets Spark Transformer API, processing the data
            and then returning the results and errors back to the pipeline for further processing. </p>

        <p class="p">When you use the Spark Evaluator in a standalone pipeline, define a parallelism value for
            the Spark Evaluator. The Spark application creates this number of partitions for each
            batch of records. The Spark Transformer processes each partition in parallel, and then
            returns the results and errors back to the pipeline.</p>

        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> When you write your custom Spark application for use in a standalone pipeline, do not
            use the <samp class="ph codeph">RDD.checkpoint()</samp> method. Checkpointing RDDs when the Spark
            Evaluator is in a standalone pipeline can cause the pipeline to fail.</div>

 </div>

</div>
<div class="topic concept nested1" id="concept_b1l_5lv_jz">
 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Cluster Pipelines</h2>

    
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can use the Spark Evaluator processor in cluster pipelines that process data from
        a Kafka or MapR cluster in cluster streaming mode. You cannot use the processor in cluster
        pipelines that process data from a MapR cluster in cluster batch mode or from HDFS. </p>

        <p class="p">In a cluster pipeline, the cluster manager spawns a <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
            worker for each topic partition in the Kafka or MapR cluster. Spark Streaming generates
            a batch for the pipeline every few seconds. Then each <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
            worker processes the batches from a single partition.</p>

        <p class="p">Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) are generated from data received across all of the
                <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> workers. The RDDs are then passed to the Spark Transformer running on the driver.</p>

        <p class="p">The RDD passed to the Spark Transformer points to data across the cluster. The Spark
            Transformer processes all of the data received across all <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
            workers in the cluster, processing multiple batches at the same time. Data moves from
            one node to another only if your custom Spark code shuffles the data. The Spark
            Transformer returns the results and errors back to each Spark Evaluator processor
            running on the <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
            workers. The <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
            workers process the remaining pipeline stages in parallel.</p>

        <p class="p">The following image shows how the Spark Transformer processes data received across all
            workers in the cluster:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_b1l_5lv_jz__image_swx_xwv_jz" src="../Graphics/SparkEvaluatorCluster.png" height="204" width="826" /></p>

        <div class="p">Use the following rules and guidelines when you write the Spark application and configure
            the processor for a cluster pipeline:<ul class="ul" id="concept_b1l_5lv_jz__ul_dg5_nmv_jz">
                <li class="li">Ensure that the Spark version you use to build the application matches the Spark
                    version used by the cluster and the Spark Evaluator stage library.</li>

                <li class="li">To maintain the states of the RDDs that are used more than once in the
                    application, use the <samp class="ph codeph">RDD.checkpoint()</samp> or
                        <samp class="ph codeph">RDD.cache()</samp> method in your custom Spark application. When
                    you checkpoint or cache the RDDs, the Spark Transformer can access the RDDs from
                    previous batches.<p class="p">The Spark Evaluator processor cleans up checkpoints when the
                        pipeline restarts or when the Spark application restarts. To maintain the
                        state of each RDD between pipeline runs or between restarts of the Spark
                        application, you must maintain the RDDs in an external store such as HDFS or
                        HBase.</p>
</li>

                <li class="li">When you configure the processor, do not define a parallelism value for the
                    processor. The number of partitions defined in the Kafka Consumer origin
                    determines the number of partitions used throughout the cluster pipeline.</li>

                <li class="li">When you configure the processor, use constant values for <samp class="ph codeph">init</samp>
                    method arguments. In a cluster pipeline, the Spark Evaluator processor cannot
                    evaluate <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span> expressions in <samp class="ph codeph">init</samp> method arguments.</li>

                <li class="li">When you monitor the running pipeline, the record throughput for intervals less
                    than 15 minutes might show an inaccurate count. To accurately monitor the
                    throughput rate, evaluate the throughput for 15 minutes or more.</li>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Developing the Spark Application</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">To develop a custom Spark
            application, you write the Spark application and then package a JAR file containing the
            application.</p>

        <p class="p">Use Java or Scala to write a custom Spark class that implements the StreamSets Spark
            Transformer API: <a class="xref" href="https://github.com/streamsets/datacollector-plugin-api/tree/master/streamsets-datacollector-spark-api" target="_blank">https://github.com/streamsets/datacollector-plugin-api/tree/master/streamsets-datacollector-spark-api</a>.</p>

        <p class="p">Include the following methods in the custom class:</p>

        <dl class="dl">
            
                <dt class="dt dlterm">init</dt>

                <dd class="dd">Optional. The <samp class="ph codeph">init</samp> method is called once when the pipeline
                    starts to read arguments that you configure in the Spark Evaluator processor.
                    Use the <samp class="ph codeph">init</samp> method to make connections to external systems or
                    to read configuration details or existing data from external systems.</dd>

            
            
                <dt class="dt dlterm">transform</dt>

                <dd class="dd">Required. The <samp class="ph codeph">transform</samp> method is called for each batch of
                    records that the pipeline processes. The Spark Evaluator processor passes a
                    batch of data to the <samp class="ph codeph">transform</samp> method as a Resilient
                    Distributed Dataset (RDD). The method processes the data according to the custom
                    code.</dd>

            
            
                <dt class="dt dlterm">destroy</dt>

                <dd class="dd">Optional. If you include an <samp class="ph codeph">init</samp> method that makes connections
                    to external systems, you should also include the <samp class="ph codeph">destroy</samp> method
                    to close the connections. The <samp class="ph codeph">destroy</samp> method is called when the
                    pipeline stops.</dd>

            
        </dl>

        <p class="p">When you finish writing the custom Spark class, package a JAR file containing the Spark
            application. Compile against the same stage library version that you use for the Spark
            Evaluator processor. For example, if you are using the Spark Evaluator processor
            included in the stage library for the Cloudera CDH version 5.9 distribution of Hadoop,
            build the application against Spark integrated into Cloudera CDH version 5.9.</p>

        <p class="p">If you used Scala to write the custom Spark class, build the application so that it is
            compatible with Scala 2.10.</p>

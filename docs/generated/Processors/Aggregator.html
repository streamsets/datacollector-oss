        <p class="p">The
            Aggregator processor performs one or more aggregations within a window of time. The
            Aggregator processor displays the results in Monitor mode and can write the results to
            event records. The processor does not update records in the data stream.</p>

        <p class="p">You might use aggregation results with <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
            data alerts to generate threshold notifications. Or, you might write the events to a
            data store and use a third-party dashboard application to visualize the data.</p>

        <p class="p">When you configure the Aggregator, you specify the window type and time window to use.
            This information determines how the processor displays data and generates events. You
            also specify the time zone to use and the aggregations to perform. </p>

        <p class="p">When you configure an aggregation, you specify the aggregation name and display title and
            the aggregation function to use. You can optionally define a filter expression to
            process a subset of the data, and a group by expression to aggregate based on groups. </p>

        <p class="p">To write the aggregation results to events, enable event generation and specify the type
            of event records to create. For general information about dataflow triggers and the
            event framework, see <a class="xref" href="../Event_Handling/EventFramework-Title.html#concept_cph_5h4_lx">Dataflow Triggers Overview</a>. </p>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Window Type, Time Windows, and Information Display</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">The aggregation window type determines the window
            of time that the Aggregator processor uses to calculate aggregations. It also determines
            how the processor generates charts and events.</p>

        <p class="p">The time window is the period of time to use for the specified window type. Time window
            behavior is specific to the window type that you select. </p>

        <p class="p">For example, when you configure a rolling window type with a one hour time window, the
            processor performs aggregations every hour on the hour using the records that passed
            through the processor during each hour. </p>

        <p class="p">Conceptually, you might say that with a rolling window, records are static within the
            window where they occur. When records become part of a particular time window, they
            remain there. And once the calculations for a time window are complete, they remain
            static as well. </p>

        <p class="p">In contrast, when you select a one hour time window for a sliding window type, the
            aggregations are always based on the records that passed through the processor in the
            past hour, providing an update of the calculations at regular intervals. </p>

        <p class="p">Conceptually, the sliding window is locked into the current time, and records slide
            through the window. Records that have moved past the window are no longer part of
            sliding window calculations.</p>

    </div>

<div class="topic concept nested2" id="concept_h5b_bf2_wbb">
 <h3 class="title topictitle3">Rolling Windows</h3>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">When using a rolling window, the Aggregator processor
            performs the aggregations on the set of records that pass through the processor within
            specific time windows. Use a rolling window to generate periodic historic analysis of
            the data passing through the pipeline.</p>

        <p class="p">With a rolling window, the time windows are incremented based on the hour, rather than on
            the start time of the pipeline. </p>

        <p class="p">For example, when you select a fifteen minute time window, the aggregations are
            calculated every fifteen minutes, starting on the hour. So if you start the pipeline at
            8:09, the first aggregation occurs at 8:15, and the following aggregations at 8:30,
            8:45, 9:00, and so on. In fact, if you start the pipeline anywhere between 8:01 and
            8:14, the aggregations start at 8:15 and continue every 15 minutes. </p>

        <p class="p">For rolling windows, the processor creates the charts in Monitor mode based on the time
            window and the Number of Time Windows to Remember. For example, if you set the property
            to 4, and use a 15 minute time window, then the resulting charts display four 15 minute
            time windows.</p>

        <p class="p">The processor also creates events with the results of the calculations based on the time
            window. So with a 15 minute time window, it generates events every 15 minutes, based on
            the hour. </p>

        <p class="p">Note that the calculations from the first event can include less than a full time-window
            of records, for reasons described above. Similarly the last event, generated when the
            pipeline stops, can include calculations with less than a full time-window of
            records.</p>

<div class="topic concept nested2" id="concept_qtg_ff2_wbb">
 <h3 class="title topictitle3">Sliding Windows</h3>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">When using a sliding window type, the Aggregation
            processor performs the aggregations on the latest set of records within the specified
            time window. With a sliding window, the time window is always relative to the current
            time.</p>

        <p class="p">Rather than capturing the history of the calculations as with a rolling window, the
            sliding window provides updates to the current set of aggregations. Use a sliding window
            to provide real time information about the data passing through the processor.</p>

        <p class="p">For example, say you configure a sliding window with a 30 second time window. When you
            run the pipeline, the processor displays a single chart with information from the
            records that passed through the processor in the last 30 seconds. And it updates the
            single chart regularly. </p>

        <p class="p">In Monitor mode, the calculations and resulting charts are updated every few seconds for
            all time window intervals. The charts indicate the time that it was last updated. </p>

        <p class="p">When generating events, the processor generates events at regular intervals based on the
            specified time window, beginning as soon as the pipeline starts. </p>

        <p class="p">For example, for a sliding window type with a time window of one hour, the processor
            generates events every minute. So if you start the pipeline at 9:08, the processor
            generates events with the results of the calculations starting at 9:09, then 9:10, 9:11,
            etc. </p>

        <p class="p">Note that the results of the first hour of calculations contain less data than the
            specified one hour time window. At 10:08, the processor provides the results of the
            first one hour time window. At 10:09, the processor includes all of the latest records
            for the last hour in the calculations, dropping the records that had arrived between
            9:08 and 9:09 since they have fallen out of the time window.</p>

        <div class="p">The following table describes how often event records are generated for each sliding time
                window:

                        expression. All aggregate functions except the COUNT function require an
                        expression. </dd>

                    <dd class="dd">For example, to determine the total sales for all transaction data in the

        <p class="p">The Aggregator processor can generate the following event records: </p>

        <dl class="dl">
            
                <dt class="dt dlterm">Single aggregation event</dt>

                <dd class="dd">You can configure the Aggregator processor to create single aggregation events.
                    Each event contains the results of a single aggregation. That is, when you
                    configure the processor to generate single aggregation events, the processor
                    produces a set of events each time the processor performs calculations. The
                    frequency of event generation depends on the selected <a class="xref" href="Aggregator.html#concept_abn_qyd_wbb">window type and time
                        window</a>. </dd>

                <dd class="dd">For example, if you have a processor configured with three aggregations with a
                    rolling time window of ten minutes and you enable single aggregation events, the
                    Aggregator processor generates three single aggregation events every ten
                    minutes.</dd>

                <dd class="dd">The processor also generates the events when the pipeline stops, to provide the
                    results of the final time window. This final event is most likely an incomplete
                    time window which can produce unexpected aggregation results.</dd>

                <dd class="dd">
                    <p class="p">You can evaluate whether a time window is complete based on the difference
                        between the time values for each event. </p>

                    <p class="p">For example, say you expect the aggregations to occur every 30 seconds, and
                        the times associated with the event records are: 1511295390, 1511295420, and
                        1511295440. You can assess that the last event was for a 20 second time
                        window instead of a 30 second time window and probably occurred because the
                        pipeline stopped. </p>

                </dd>

                <dd class="dd">To generate single aggregation events, configure both of the following
                        properties:<ul class="ul" id="concept_bc4_c42_wbb__ul_f4x_mhd_1cb">

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Monitoring Aggregations</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">In
            addition to standard stage statistics, the Aggregator processor provides aggregation
            charts that you can monitor when you run the pipeline. The processor generates one chart
            for every aggregation, using the specified title for the chart name. </p>

        <p class="p">The contents and display of the charts depend on the aggregation and stage properties.
            For example, when using a group by expression, the chart displays a bar for each group. </p>

        <p class="p">When using a sliding window, charts display the date and time that the chart was last
            updated. </p>

        <p class="p">When using a rolling window, charts contain the results for multiple time windows based
            on the Number of Time Windows to Remember property. Charts display the date and time
            that the time window closes. The most recent time window can be in progress, displaying
            the latest details as the processor continues to aggregate data within the time
            window.</p>

        <p class="p">For example, say you have an Aggregator processor using a rolling window and a 30 second
            time window. It is configured to remember three time windows and uses the following
            aggregation to perform a sum of all sales, using a filter to exclude returns:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_qxw_k42_wbb__image_pmc_hh1_xbb" src="../Graphics/Aggregator-Sum.png" height="296" width="415" /></p>

        <p class="p">The processor generates the following "total sales" chart:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_qxw_k42_wbb__image_iwm_zf1_xbb" src="../Graphics/Aggregator-SumChart.png" height="198" width="831" /></p>

        <p class="p">Notice, the aggregate function, SUM (double), displays on the left side of the chart and
            the end of each time window displays under each bar. You can see that the interval
            between the time windows is 30 seconds, as configured in the stage. </p>

        <p class="p">The results for the third time window seem low, but this is because the time window is
            still active -- the calculations are ongoing and the results are updated until the time
            window closes. Like other <span class="ph">Data
                  Collector</span>
            charts and graphs, when you hover over a particular section, relevant details display.
            In this case, the "value" is the sum of the sales that occurred in the time window.</p>

        <p class="p">In the same Aggregator processor, you might use the following aggregation configuration
            to determine the count of sales and returns. The group by expression enables counting
            each transaction type:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_qxw_k42_wbb__image_kt5_f31_xbb" src="../Graphics/Aggregator-Count-Group.png" height="252" width="415" /></p>

        <p class="p">In the resulting "transaction types" chart, the COUNT function displays on the left, and
            separate bars represent the return and sale groups:</p>

        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_qxw_k42_wbb__image_acp_4m1_xbb" src="../Graphics/Aggregator-CountChart-GroupBy.png" height="161" width="691" /></p>

        <p class="p">To view Aggregator charts and statistics, view the pipeline in Monitor mode, and then
            select the Aggregator processor.</p>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Directory Templates</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">The Local FS destination uses directory templates to create output and
   late record directories. Local FS writes records to the directories based on the configured time
   basis.</p>

    <p class="p">You can alternatively write records to directories based
                  on the targetDirectory record header attribute. Using the targetDirectory
                  attribute disables the ability to define directory templates.</p>

  <p class="p">When you define a directory template, you can use a mix
                  of constants, field values, and datetime variables. You can use the
                        <samp class="ph codeph">every</samp> function to create new directories at regular
                  intervals based on seconds or minutes. You can also use the
                        <samp class="ph codeph">record:valueOrDefault</samp> function to use field values or a
                  default in the directory template. </p>

  <div class="p">For example, the following directory template creates
                  output directories for event data based on the state and timestamp of a record
                  with hours as the smallest unit of measure, creating a new directory every twelve
                  hours:<pre class="pre codeblock"> /outputfiles/${record:valueOrDefault("/State", "unknown")}/${YY()}-${MM()}-${DD()}-${every(12,hh())}</pre>
</div>

  <div class="p">You can use the following elements in a directory template:<dl class="dl">
                        
                              <dt class="dt dlterm">Constants</dt>

                              <dd class="dd">You can use any constant, such as "output" or "lateRecords."</dd>

                        
                        
                              <dt class="dt dlterm">Datetime Variables</dt>

                              <dd class="dd">You can use datetime variables, such as <samp class="ph codeph">${YYYY()}</samp>
                                    or <samp class="ph codeph">${DD()}</samp>. The destination creates directories
                                    as needed, based on the smallest datetime variable that you use.
                                    For example, if the smallest variable is hours, then the
                                    directories are created for every hour of the day that receives
                                    output records.</dd>

                              <dd class="dd">When you use datetime variables in an expression, use all of the
                                    datetime variables between one of the year variables and the
                                    smallest variable that you want to use. For example, to create
                                    directories on a daily basis for a Hadoop FS destination, use a
                                    year variable, a month variable, and then a day variable. You
                                    might use one of the following datetime variable progressions: </dd>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Time Basis</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">When using directory templates, the time basis
   helps determine when directories are created. It also determines the directory Local FS uses when

  <p class="p"><span class="ph">When using the targetDirectory record header attribute

                        late.</span>
  </p>

  <p class="p">You can use the following times as the time basis:</p>

  <dl class="dl">

                        <dd class="dd">For example, say a directory template creates directories every minute
                              and the time basis is the time of processing. Then, directories are

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Late Records and Late Record Handling </h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p"></p>

        <p class="p">When you use a record time as the time basis, you can define
                  a time limit for records to be written to their associated output file. When the
                  destination creates a new output file in a new directory, the previous output file
                  is kept open for the specified late record time limit. When records that belong in
                  that file arrive within the time limit, the destination writes the records to the
                  open output file. When the late record time limit is reached, the output file is
                  closed and any record that arrives past this limit is considered late.</p>

        <div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> The late records properties are not applicable if
                  you use processing time as the time basis. If you use processing time, set the
                  late record time limit to one second.</div>

     <p class="p">You can send late records to a late records file or to the
                  stage for error handling. When you send records to a late records file, you define
                  a late records directory template. </p>

        <div class="p">For example, you use a record time as the time basis,
                  configure a one hour late record time limit, configure late records to be sent to
                  the stage for error handling, and use the default directory template value:
                  <pre class="pre codeblock">/tmp/out/${YYYY()}-${MM()}-${DD()}-${hh()} </pre>
</div>

        <p class="p">The first records that arrive have a datetime between the
                  hours of 02:00 and 02:59, and so are written to an output file in the 02
                  directory. When records with a datetime between the hours of 03:00 and 03:59
                  arrive, the destination creates a new file in an 03 directory. The destination
                  keeps the file in the 02 directory open for another hour. </p>

        <p class="p">If a record with a datetime between the hours of 02:00 and
                  02:59 arrives before the hour time limit, the destination writes the record to the
                  open file in the 02 directory. After one hour, the destination closes the output
                  file in the 02 directory. Any records with a datetime between the hours of 02:00
                  and 02:59 that arrive after the one hour time limit are considered late. The late
                  records are sent to the stage for error handling.</p>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Timeout to Close Idle Files</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">You can configure the maximum
            time that an open output file can remain idle. After no records are written to an output

        <p class="p">You might want to configure an idle timeout when output
                  files remain open and idle for too long, thus delaying another system from

        <div class="p">Output files might remain idle for too long for the following

                              arriving. An output file that has not reached the maximum number of
                              records or the maximum file size stays open until more records
                              arrive.</li>

                        <li class="li">You configured a date field in the record as the time basis and have
                              configured a late record time limit, but records arrive in
                              chronological order. When a new directory is created, the output file
                              in the previous directory remains open for the configured late record
                              time limit. However, no records are ever written to the open file in
                              the previous directory.<p class="p">For example, when a record with a datetime
                                    of 03:00 arrives, the destination creates a new file in a new 03
                                    directory. The previous file in the 02 directory is kept open
                                    for the late record time limit, which is an hour by default.
                                    However, when records arrive in chronological order, no records
                                    that belong in the 02 directory arrive after the 03 directory is
                                    created. </p>

By default, the Java heap size is 1024 MB. When you use Data Collector with Java 7, you can define the Java Permanent Generation size, also known as the PermGen size.By default, Data Collector is configured to use TLS versions 1.1 and 1.2. To connect to a system that uses an earlier version of TLS, modify the Dhttps.protocols option in the SDC_JAVA_OPTS environment variable in the Data Collector environment configuration file.Data Collector includes a Java Security Manager that is enabled by default.

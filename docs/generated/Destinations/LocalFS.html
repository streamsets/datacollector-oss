 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Directory Templates</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">The Local FS destination uses directory templates to create output and
   late record directories. Local FS writes records to the directories based on the configured time
   basis.</p>

    <p class="p">You can alternatively write records to directories based
                  on the targetDirectory record header attribute. Using the targetDirectory
                  attribute disables the ability to define directory templates.</p>

  <p class="p">When you define a directory template, you can use a mix
                  of constants, field values, and datetime variables. You can use the
                        <samp class="ph codeph">every</samp> function to create new directories at regular
                  intervals based on hours, minutes, or seconds, starting on the hour. You can also
                  use the <samp class="ph codeph">record:valueOrDefault</samp> function to use field values or a
                  default in the directory template. </p>

  <div class="p">For example, the following directory template creates
                  output directories for event data based on the state and timestamp of a record
                  with hours as the smallest unit of measure, creating a new directory every
                  hour:<pre class="pre codeblock"> /outputfiles/${record:valueOrDefault("/State", "unknown")}/${YY()}-${MM()}-${DD()}-${hh()}</pre>
</div>

  <div class="p">You can use the following elements in a directory template:<dl class="dl">
                        
                              <dt class="dt dlterm">Constants</dt>

                              <dd class="dd">You can use any constant, such as "output".</dd>

                        
                        
                              <dt class="dt dlterm">Datetime Variables</dt>

                              <dd class="dd">You can use datetime variables, such as <samp class="ph codeph">${YYYY()}</samp>
                                    or <samp class="ph codeph">${DD()}</samp>. The destination creates directories
                                    as needed, based on the smallest datetime variable that you use.
                                    For example, if the smallest variable is hours, then the
                                    directories are created for every hour of the day that receives
                                    output records.</dd>

                              <dd class="dd">When you use datetime variables in an expression, use all of the
                                    datetime variables between one of the year variables and the
                                    smallest variable that you want to use. For example, to create
                                    directories on a daily basis for a Hadoop FS destination, use a
                                    year variable, a month variable, and then a day variable. You
                                    might use one of the following datetime variable progressions: </dd>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Time Basis</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">When using directory templates, the time basis
   helps determine when directories are created. It also determines the directory Local FS uses when
   writing a record, and whether a record is late.</p>

  <p class="p"><span class="ph">When using the targetDirectory record header attribute
                        to write records, the time basis determines only whether a record is
                        late.</span>
  </p>

  <p class="p">You can use the following times as the time basis:</p>

  <dl class="dl">

                              and writes records to the directories based on when they are
                              processed.</dd>

                        <dd class="dd">For example, say a directory template creates directories every minute
                              and the time basis is the time of processing. Then, directories are

                              And the output records are written to the directory for that minute of
                              processing. </dd>

                        <dd class="dd">To use the processing time as the time basis, use the following

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Late Records and Late Record Handling </h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p"></p>

        <p class="p">When you use a record time as the time basis, you can define
                  a time limit for records to be written to their associated output file. When the
                  destination creates a new output file in a new directory, the previous output file
                  is kept open for the specified late record time limit. When records that belong in
                  that file arrive within the time limit, the destination writes the records to the
                  open output file. When the late record time limit is reached, the output file is
                  closed and any record that arrives past this limit is considered late.</p>

        <div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> The late records properties are not applicable if
                  you use processing time as the time basis. If you use processing time, set the
                  late record time limit to one second.</div>

     <p class="p">You can send late records to a late records file or to the
                  stage for error handling. When you send records to a late records file, you define
                  a late records directory template. </p>

        <div class="p">For example, you use a record time as the time basis,
                  configure a one hour late record time limit, configure late records to be sent to
                  the stage for error handling, and use the default directory template value:
                  <pre class="pre codeblock">/tmp/out/${YYYY()}-${MM()}-${DD()}-${hh()} </pre>
</div>

        <p class="p">The first records that arrive have a datetime between the
                  hours of 02:00 and 02:59, and so are written to an output file in the 02
                  directory. When records with a datetime between the hours of 03:00 and 03:59
                  arrive, the destination creates a new file in an 03 directory. The destination
                  keeps the file in the 02 directory open for another hour. </p>

        <p class="p">If a record with a datetime between the hours of 02:00 and
                  02:59 arrives before the hour time limit, the destination writes the record to the
                  open file in the 02 directory. After one hour, the destination closes the output
                  file in the 02 directory. Any records with a datetime between the hours of 02:00
                  and 02:59 that arrive after the one hour time limit are considered late. The late
                  records are sent to the stage for error handling.</p>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Timeout to Close Idle Files</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">

        <p class="p">You might want to configure an idle timeout when output

                              in the previous directory remains open for the configured late record
                              time limit. However, no records are ever written to the open file in

                                    for the late record time limit, which is an hour by default.

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Recovery</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">The Local FS destination supports recovery after an
            unexpected stop of the pipeline by renaming temporary files when the pipeline
            restarts.</p>

     <div class="p">The destination names temporary open output files using the
                  following format:<pre class="pre codeblock">_tmp_&lt;prefix&gt;_&lt;runnerId&gt;</pre>
Where
                        <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;prefix&gt;</samp> is the file prefix defined for the destination
                  and <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;runnerId&gt;</samp> is the ID of the pipeline runner performing the
                  pipeline processing. For example, when the destination prefix is defined as
                        <samp class="ph codeph">sdc</samp> and the destination runs from a single-threaded
                  pipeline, the temporary file is named like so: <samp class="ph codeph">_tmp_sdc_0</samp>. </div>
<div class="p">When the destination closes the file, either after it is fully
                  written, after the idle timeout expires, or when you deliberately stop the
                  pipeline, it renames the file to remove the <samp class="ph codeph">_tmp_</samp> string and to
                  replace the pipeline runner ID with a random unique identifier like
                  so:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;prefix&gt;_e7ce67c5-013d-47a7-9496-8c882ddb28a0</pre>
</div>
<p class="p">However, when the pipeline stops unexpectedly, the temporary
                  files remain. When the pipeline restarts, the destination scans all subdirectories
                  of the defined directory template to rename any temporary files that match the
                  defined prefix for the destination. After the destination renames the temporary
                  files, it continues writing to new output files.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The destination renames all temporary files that match the
                  defined prefix in all subdirectories of the defined directory template, even if
                  those files were not written by that pipeline. So if you happen to have another
                  file whose name begins with the same pattern - <samp class="ph codeph">_tmp_&lt;prefix&gt;</samp> -
                  the destination renames that file also.</div>
<div class="p">The destination might not rename all temporary files in the
                  following situations:<dl class="dl">
                        
                              <dt class="dt dlterm">The directory template includes an expression with the
                                    record:value or record:valueOrDefault function.</dt>

                              <dd class="dd">If the record:value or record:valueOrDefault function evaluates to
                                    an empty string or to a subdirectory, the destination cannot
                                    determine those locations when the pipeline restarts. As a
                                    result, the destination cannot rename any temporary files
                                    written to those locations.</dd>

                              <dd class="dd">For example, let’s assume that the directory template is defined
                                    as
                                    follows:<pre class="pre codeblock">/tmp/out/${YY()}-${MM()}-${DD()}/${sdc:hostname()}/${record:value('/a')}/${record:value('/b')}</pre>
</dd>

                              <dd class="dd">If the expression <samp class="ph codeph">${record:value('/b')}</samp> evaluates
                                    to an empty string or to a subdirectory such as
                                          <samp class="ph codeph">/folder1/folder2</samp>, then the destination
                                    cannot determine those locations when the pipeline restarts.
                              </dd>

                        
                        
                              <dt class="dt dlterm">The directory is defined in the targetDirectory record header
                                    attribute.</dt>

                              <dd class="dd">When the directory is defined in the targetDirectory record header
                                    attribute, the destination cannot determine where to look for
                                    temporary files when the pipeline restarts. As a result, it
                                    cannot rename the temporary files.</dd>

                        
                  </dl>
</div>
<p class="p">In either of these situations, you must manually rename the
                  temporary files.</p>
<p class="p">File recovery can slow down the pipeline as it restarts. If
                  needed, you can configure the destination to skip file recovery.</p>

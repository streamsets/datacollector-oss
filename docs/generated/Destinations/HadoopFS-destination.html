            sequence files. You can also use the whole file data format to write whole files to
            HDFS.</p>

        <p class="p">When you configure a Hadoop FS destination, <span class="ph">you can define a directory template and time basis to
                        determine the output directories that the destination creates and the files
                        where records are written. </span></p>

        <p class="p">As part of the Drift Synchronization Solution for
                  Hive, you can alternatively use record header attributes to perform record-based
                  writes. You can write records to the specified directory, use the defined Avro
                  schema, and roll files based on record header attributes. For more information,
                  see <a class="xref" href="../Pipeline_Design/RecordHeaderAttributes.html#concept_lmn_gdc_1w">Record Header Attributes for Record-Based Writes</a>.</p>

        <p class="p">You can define a file prefix and suffix, the data time zone, and
                  properties that define when the destination closes a file. You can specify the
                  amount of time that a record can be written to its associated directory and what
                  happens to late records.</p>

        <p class="p">You can configure the Hadoop FS destination to write to Azure HDInsight.</p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph">The destination can generate events for an event stream. For

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Directory Templates</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">By default, the Hadoop FS destination uses directory templates
      to create output and late record directories. Hadoop FS writes records to the directories
      based on the configured time basis. </p>

    <p class="p">You can alternatively write records to directories based
                  on the targetDirectory record header attribute. Using the targetDirectory
                  attribute disables the ability to define directory templates.</p>

  <p class="p">When you define a directory template, you can use a mix
                  of constants, field values, and datetime variables. You can use the
                        <samp class="ph codeph">every</samp> function to create new directories at regular
                  intervals based on hours, minutes, or seconds, starting on the hour. You can also
                  use the <samp class="ph codeph">record:valueOrDefault</samp> function to use field values or a
                  default in the directory template. </p>

  <div class="p">For example, the following directory template creates
                  output directories for event data based on the state and timestamp of a record
                  with hours as the smallest unit of measure, creating a new directory every
                  hour:<pre class="pre codeblock"> /outputfiles/${record:valueOrDefault("/State", "unknown")}/${YY()}-${MM()}-${DD()}-${hh()}</pre>
</div>

  <div class="p">You can use the following elements in a directory template:<dl class="dl">
                        
                              <dt class="dt dlterm">Constants</dt>

                              <dd class="dd">You can use any constant, such as "output".</dd>

                        
                        
                              <dt class="dt dlterm">Datetime Variables</dt>

                              <dd class="dd">You can use datetime variables, such as <samp class="ph codeph">${YYYY()}</samp>
                                    or <samp class="ph codeph">${DD()}</samp>. The destination creates directories
                                    as needed, based on the smallest datetime variable that you use.
                                    For example, if the smallest variable is hours, then the
                                    directories are created for every hour of the day that receives
                                    output records.</dd>

                              <dd class="dd">When you use datetime variables in an expression, use all of the
                                    datetime variables between one of the year variables and the
                                    smallest variable that you want to use. For example, to create
                                    directories on a daily basis for a Hadoop FS destination, use a
                                    year variable, a month variable, and then a day variable. You
                                    might use one of the following datetime variable progressions: </dd>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Time Basis</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">When using directory templates, the time basis
   helps determine when directories are created. It also determines the directory Hadoop FS uses
   when writing a record, and whether a record is late.</p>

  <p class="p"><span class="ph">When using the targetDirectory record header attribute
                        to write records, the time basis determines only whether a record is

  <p class="p">You can use the following times as the time basis: </p>

  <dl class="dl">

                              and the time basis is the time of processing. Then, directories are

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Late Records and Late Record Handling </h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p"></p>

        <p class="p">When you use a record time as the time basis, you can define
                  a time limit for records to be written to their associated output file. When the
                  destination creates a new output file in a new directory, the previous output file
                  is kept open for the specified late record time limit. When records that belong in
                  that file arrive within the time limit, the destination writes the records to the
                  open output file. When the late record time limit is reached, the output file is
                  closed and any record that arrives past this limit is considered late.</p>

        <div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> The late records properties are not applicable if
                  you use processing time as the time basis. If you use processing time, set the
                  late record time limit to one second.</div>

     <p class="p">You can send late records to a late records file or to the
                  stage for error handling. When you send records to a late records file, you define
                  a late records directory template. </p>

        <div class="p">For example, you use a record time as the time basis,
                  configure a one hour late record time limit, configure late records to be sent to
                  the stage for error handling, and use the default directory template value:
                  <pre class="pre codeblock">/tmp/out/${YYYY()}-${MM()}-${DD()}-${hh()} </pre>
</div>

        <p class="p">The first records that arrive have a datetime between the
                  hours of 02:00 and 02:59, and so are written to an output file in the 02
                  directory. When records with a datetime between the hours of 03:00 and 03:59
                  arrive, the destination creates a new file in an 03 directory. The destination
                  keeps the file in the 02 directory open for another hour. </p>

        <p class="p">If a record with a datetime between the hours of 02:00 and
                  02:59 arrives before the hour time limit, the destination writes the record to the
                  open file in the 02 directory. After one hour, the destination closes the output
                  file in the 02 directory. Any records with a datetime between the hours of 02:00
                  and 02:59 that arrive after the one hour time limit are considered late. The late

                              chronological order. When a new directory is created, the output file
                              in the previous directory remains open for the configured late record
                              time limit. However, no records are ever written to the open file in

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Recovery</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
  <p class="p">The Hadoop FS destination supports recovery after an
            unexpected stop of the pipeline by renaming temporary files when the pipeline
            restarts.</p>

        <div class="p">The destination names temporary open output files using the
                  following format:<pre class="pre codeblock">_tmp_&lt;prefix&gt;_&lt;runnerId&gt;</pre>
Where
                        <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;prefix&gt;</samp> is the file prefix defined for the destination
                  and <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;runnerId&gt;</samp> is the ID of the pipeline runner performing the
                  pipeline processing. For example, when the destination prefix is defined as
                        <samp class="ph codeph">sdc</samp> and the destination runs from a single-threaded
                  pipeline, the temporary file is named like so: <samp class="ph codeph">_tmp_sdc_0</samp>. </div>
<div class="p">When the destination closes the file, either after it is fully
                  written, after the idle timeout expires, or when you deliberately stop the
                  pipeline, it renames the file to remove the <samp class="ph codeph">_tmp_</samp> string and to
                  replace the pipeline runner ID with a random unique identifier like
                  so:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;prefix&gt;_e7ce67c5-013d-47a7-9496-8c882ddb28a0</pre>
</div>
<p class="p">However, when the pipeline stops unexpectedly, the temporary
                  files remain. When the pipeline restarts, the destination scans all subdirectories
                  of the defined directory template to rename any temporary files that match the
                  defined prefix for the destination. After the destination renames the temporary
                  files, it continues writing to new output files.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The destination renames all temporary files that match the
                  defined prefix in all subdirectories of the defined directory template, even if
                  those files were not written by that pipeline. So if you happen to have another
                  file whose name begins with the same pattern - <samp class="ph codeph">_tmp_&lt;prefix&gt;</samp> -
                  the destination renames that file also.</div>
<div class="p">The destination might not rename all temporary files in the

                              <dd class="dd">If the record:value or record:valueOrDefault function evaluates to
                                    an empty string or to a subdirectory, the destination cannot
                                    determine those locations when the pipeline restarts. As a
                                    result, the destination cannot rename any temporary files
                                    written to those locations.</dd>

                              <dd class="dd">For example, let’s assume that the directory template is defined
                                    as
                                    follows:<pre class="pre codeblock">/tmp/out/${YY()}-${MM()}-${DD()}/${sdc:hostname()}/${record:value('/a')}/${record:value('/b')}</pre>

                                    cannot rename the temporary files.</dd>

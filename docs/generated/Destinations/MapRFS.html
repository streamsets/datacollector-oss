        files or Hadoop sequence files. </p>

        <p class="p">When you configure a MapR FS destination, <span class="ph">you can define a directory template and time basis to
                        determine the output directories that the destination creates and the files
                        where records are written. </span></p>

        <p class="p">As part of the Hive Drift Solution, you can
                  alternatively use record header attributes to perform record-based writes. You can
                  write records to the specified directory, use the defined Avro schema, and roll
                  files based on record header attributes. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="Destinations_overview.html#concept_lmn_gdc_1w">Record Header Attributes for Record-Based Writes</a>.</p>

        <p class="p">You can define a file prefix, the data time zone, and properties
                  that define when the destination closes a file. You can specify the amount of time
                  that a record can be written to its associated directory and what happens to late
                  records.</p>

        <p class="p">When necessary, you can use Kerberos to connect to MapR FS or use an HDFS user to connect
            to MapR FS. You can also use HDFS configuration files and add other HDFS configuration
            properties as needed. </p>

        <p class="p">You can use Gzip, Bzip2, Snappy, LZ4, and other compression
                  formats to write output files. </p>
  <p class="p">Before you use any MapR stage in a pipeline, you must perform

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Directory Templates</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">By default, the MapR FS destination uses directory
            templates to create output and late record directories. The destination writes records
            to the directories based on the configured time basis.</p>

        <p class="p">You can alternatively write records to directories based
                  on the targetDirectory record header attribute. Using the targetDirectory
                  attribute disables the ability to define directory templates.</p>

        <p class="p">When you define a directory template, you can use a mix
                  of constants, field values, and datetime variables. You can use the
                        <samp class="ph codeph">every</samp> function to create new directories at regular
                  intervals based on seconds or minutes. You can also use the
                        <samp class="ph codeph">record:valueOrDefault</samp> function to use field values or a
                  default in the directory template. </p>

        <div class="p">For example, the following directory template creates
                  output directories for event data based on the state and timestamp of a record
                  with hours as the smallest unit of measure, creating a new directory every twelve
                  hours:<pre class="pre codeblock"> /outputfiles/${record:valueOrDefault("/State", "unknown")}/${YY()}-${MM()}-${DD()}-${every(12,hh())}</pre>
</div>

        <div class="p">You can use the following elements in a directory template:<dl class="dl">
                        
                              <dt class="dt dlterm">Constants</dt>

                              <dd class="dd">You can use any constant, such as "output" or "lateRecords."</dd>

                        
                        
                              <dt class="dt dlterm">Datetime Variables</dt>

                              <dd class="dd">You can use datetime variables, such as <samp class="ph codeph">${YYYY()}</samp>
                                    or <samp class="ph codeph">${DD()}</samp>. The destination creates directories
                                    as needed, based on the smallest datetime variable that you use.
                                    For example, if the smallest variable is hours, then the
                                    directories are created for every hour of the day that receives
                                    output records.</dd>

                              <dd class="dd">When you use datetime variables in an expression, use all of the
                                    datetime variables between one of the year variables and the
                                    smallest variable that you want to use. For example, to create
                                    directories on a daily basis for a Hadoop FS destination, use a
                                    year variable, a month variable, and then a day variable. You
                                    might use one of the following datetime variable progressions: </dd>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Time Basis</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p">When using directory templates, the time basis helps
            determine when directories are created. It also determines the directory MapR FS uses
            when writing a record, and whether a record is late.</p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph">When using the targetDirectory record header attribute
                        to write records, the time basis determines only whether a record is

        </p>

        <p class="p">You can use the following times as the time basis: </p>

 <h2 class="title topictitle2">Late Records and Late Record Handling</h2>

 <div class="body conbody">
        <p class="p"></p>

        <p class="p">When you use a record time as the time basis, you can define
                  a time limit for records to be written to their associated output file. When the
                  destination creates a new output file in a new directory, the previous output file
                  is kept open for the specified late record time limit. When records that belong in
                  that file arrive within the time limit, the destination writes the records to the
                  open output file. When the late record time limit is reached, the output file is
                  closed and any record that arrives past this limit is considered late.</p>

        <div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> The late records properties are not applicable if
                  you use processing time as the time basis. If you use processing time, set the
                  late record time limit to one second.</div>

     <p class="p">You can send late records to a late records file or to the
                  stage for error handling. When you send records to a late records file, you define
                  a late records directory template. </p>

        <div class="p">For example, you use a record time as the time basis,
                  configure a one hour late record time limit, configure late records to be sent to
                  the stage for error handling, and use the default directory template value:
                  <pre class="pre codeblock">/tmp/out/${YYYY()}-${MM()}-${DD()}-${hh()} </pre>
</div>

        <p class="p">The first records that arrive have a datetime between the
                  hours of 02:00 and 02:59, and so are written to an output file in the 02
                  directory. When records with a datetime between the hours of 03:00 and 03:59
                  arrive, the destination creates a new file in an 03 directory. The destination
                  keeps the file in the 02 directory open for another hour. </p>

        <p class="p">If a record with a datetime between the hours of 02:00 and
                  02:59 arrives before the hour time limit, the destination writes the record to the
                  open file in the 02 directory. After one hour, the destination closes the output
                  file in the 02 directory. Any records with a datetime between the hours of 02:00
                  and 02:59 that arrive after the one hour time limit are considered late. The late
                  records are sent to the stage for error handling.</p>

                                    directory. The previous file in the 02 directory is kept open
                                    for the late record time limit, which is an hour by default.
                                    However, when records arrive in chronological order, no records
                                    that belong in the 02 directory arrive after the 03 directory is

To connect to a system that uses an earlier version of TLS, modify the Dhttps.protocols option in the SDC_JAVA_OPTS environment variable in the Data Collector environment configuration file.Data Collector includes a Java Security Manager that is enabled by default. You can edit the Data Collector environment configuration file to configure the path to jar files to be added to the Data Collector root classloader.">Data Collector Environment Configuration</a>.</p>

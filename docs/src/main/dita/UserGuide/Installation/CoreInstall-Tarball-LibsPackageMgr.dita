                libraries</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>Package Manager<indexterm>installing
                    additional libraries</indexterm></indexterm>You can use the Package Manager
            within <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> to
            install additional tarball stage libraries. </p>
        <p>Complete one of the following steps to display the Package Manager:</p>
        <ul id="ul_lnr_4y4_xx">
            <li>
                <p>Click the <uicontrol>Package Manager</uicontrol> icon <image
                        href="../Graphics/icon_PackageManager.png" scale="80" id="image_rt4_qsl_nx"
                    />.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Click <uicontrol>Add/Remove Stages</uicontrol> in the stage library when viewing a
                pipeline in the pipeline canvas.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Package Manager lists all available stage libraries, displaying a check mark next to
            each installed library. You can filter the stage libraries by type or you can search for
            a stage library in the list.</p>
        <p>For example, the following image displays three installed stage libraries:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/PackageManager.png" scale="65" id="image_gct_3vl_nx"/></p>
        <p>To install an additional stage library, click the <uicontrol>More</uicontrol> icon for
            the library, and then click <uicontrol>Install</uicontrol>. Or to install multiple stage
            libraries, select the libraries in the list and then click the
                <uicontrol>Install</uicontrol> icon <image href="../Graphics/icon_InstallLib.png"
                scale="70" id="image_z4c_s3m_nx"/>. Confirm that you want to install the libraries,
            and then restart <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            for the changes to take effect.</p>
        <p>To uninstall a stage library, click the <uicontrol>More</uicontrol> icon for the library,
            and then click <uicontrol>Uninstall</uicontrol>. Or to uninstall multiple stage
            libraries, select the libraries in the list and then click the
                <uicontrol>Uninstall</uicontrol> icon <image
                href="../Graphics/icon_UninstallLib.png" scale="70" id="image_svh_y3m_nx"/>. Confirm
            that you want to uninstall the libraries, and then restart <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            for the changes to take effect.<note>If <ph
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                /> does not have internet connectivity, you can view the installed stage libraries
                and can uninstall a stage library. However, you cannot view all stage libraries or
                install an additional stage library.</note></p>
        <p>For information about the stages installed with each stage library, see <xref

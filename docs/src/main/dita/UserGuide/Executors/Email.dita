                    executor<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>The Email executor sends the
            configured email to the specified recipients upon receiving an event. You can also
            configure the executor to send an email based on a condition, such as the arrival of a
            specific type of event. </p>
        <p>You can configure the Email executor to send multiple emails, each with its own
            condition, set of recipients, and email message. You can use expressions in all email
            fields. </p>
        <p>Before you use an Email executor in a pipeline, you must enable <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> to
            send email. For more information about configuring <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            and other ways to configure notification, see <xref
                href="../Configuration/SendingEmail.dita#concept_it1_wwg_xz"/>. </p>
        <p>For a case study about using the Email executor, see <xref

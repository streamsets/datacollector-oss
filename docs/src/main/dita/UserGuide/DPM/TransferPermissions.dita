 <title>Transfer Permissions to <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
        Users</title>
 <conbody>
        <p>After you register <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            with <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"
            />, transfer permissions from the obsolete <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            users and groups to the new <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
            users and groups.</p>
        <p>When pipeline access controls are enabled in <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>,
            pipeline permissions determine the access that each user has to a pipeline. Any user
            without the Admin role requires read permission to view a pipeline. So by default, only
                <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
            users with the Organization Administrator or <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            Administrator roles can access pipelines immediately after registering <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
            />.</p>
        <p>To enable other users to access pipelines, transfer pipeline permissions to <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
            users and groups. When you transfer permissions, all permissions associated with a user
            or group transfers to the specified user or group. If you need to customize pipeline
            permissions, you can edit each pipeline individually.</p>
        <p>For information about transferring pipeline permissions, see <xref
                href="../Configuration/TransferPipePermissions.dita#concept_p11_msc_1z"/>. For
            information about configuring permissions for individual pipelines, see <xref

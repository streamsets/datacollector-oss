 <title>Migrate to Java 8</title>
 <shortdesc><ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
        version 2.5.0.0 requires Java 8. If your previous <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
        version ran on Java 7, you must migrate to Java 8 before upgrading to the latest <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
        version.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
        <p>All services that use Data Collector JAR files also must run on Java 8. This means that
            your Hadoop cluster must run on Java 8 if you are using cluster pipelines, the Spark
            Executor, or the MapReduce Executor. </p>
        <p>To migrate to Java 8, complete the following steps before upgrading to the latest <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            version:</p>
        <ol id="ol_h33_fhp_hz">
            <li>Shut down <ph
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                />.</li>
            <li>Install Java 8 on the <ph
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                /> machine.</li>
            <li>If you customized Java configuration options in the SDC_JAVA7_OPTS environment
                variable and if those options are valid in Java 8, migrate those customizations to
                the SDC_JAVA8_OPTS environment variable.</li>
            <li>Restart <ph
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                /> and verify that it works as expected.</li>
            <li>If any pipelines include the JavaScript Evaluator processor, open the pipelines and
                validate the scripts on Java 8. </li>

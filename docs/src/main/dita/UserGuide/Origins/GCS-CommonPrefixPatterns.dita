 <title>Common Prefix, Prefix Pattern, and Wildcards</title>
    <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>Google Cloud Storage origin<indexterm>common prefix and prefix
                    pattern</indexterm></indexterm>The Google Cloud Storage origin appends the
            common prefix to the prefix pattern to define the objects that the origin processes. You
            can specify an exact prefix pattern or you can use Ant-style path patterns to read
            multiple objects recursively.</p>
        <p>Ant-style path patterns can include the following wildcards: <ul id="ul_lg1_gyd_wv">
                <li>Question mark (?) to match a single character</li>
                <li>Asterisk (*) to match zero or more characters</li>
                <li>Double asterisks (**) to match zero or more directories</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p>For example, to process all log files in <codeph>US/East/MD/</codeph> and all nested
            prefixes, you can use the following common prefix and prefix
            pattern:<codeblock>Common Prefix: US/East/MD/
Prefix Pattern: **/*.log</codeblock></p>
        <p>If the unnamed nested prefixes that you want to include appear earlier in the hierarchy,
            such as <codeph> US/**/weblogs/</codeph>, you can include the nested prefixes in the
            prefix pattern or define the entire hierarchy in the prefix pattern, as
            follows:<codeblock>Common Prefix: US/
Prefix Pattern: **/weblogs/*.log

Common Prefix: 
Prefix Pattern: US/**/weblogs/*.log</codeblock></p>
    </conbody>

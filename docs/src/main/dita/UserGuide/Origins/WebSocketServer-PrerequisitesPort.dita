 <title>Send Data to the Listening Port</title>
 <shortdesc>Configure the WebSocket clients to send data to the WebSocket Server listening
        port.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
        <p>When you configure the WebSocket Server origin, you define a listening port number where
            the origin listens for data. To pass data to the pipeline, configure each WebSocket
            client to send data to a URL that includes the listening port number.<draft-comment
                author="alisontaylor">same as the Prerequisites for HTTP Server origin, make updates
                in both places</draft-comment></p>
        <p>Use the following format for the
            URL:<codeblock>&lt;ws | wss>://&lt;sdc_hostname>:&lt;listening_port>/</codeblock></p>
        <p>The URL includes the following components:</p>
     <ul id="ul_ml5_ljq_4y">
         <li>&lt;ws | wss> - Use wss for secure WebSocket connections over HTTPS. </li>
         <li>&lt;sdc_hostname> - The <ph
             conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
         /> host name.</li>
         <li>&lt;listening_port> - The port number where the origin listens for
             data. </li>
     </ul>
        <p>For example: <codeph>wss://localhost:8080/</codeph></p>

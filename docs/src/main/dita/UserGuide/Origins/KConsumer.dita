 <title>Kafka Consumer</title>

  <p><indexterm>Kafka Consumer
          origin<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>origins<indexterm>Kafka
          Consumer</indexterm></indexterm>The Kafka Consumer origin reads data from a single topic
      in an Apache Kafka cluster. To use multiple threads to read from multiple topics, use the
        <xref href="KafkaMultiConsumer.dita#concept_ccs_fn4_x1b">Kafka Multitopic Consumer</xref>. </p>
    <p>When you configure a Kafka Consumer, you configure the consumer group name, topic, and
      ZooKeeper connection information. </p>
    <p>When using Kafka version 0.8.2 or later to consume messages in the Avro format, you can
      configure the Kafka Consumer to work with the Confluent Schema Registry. The Confluent Schema
      Registry is a distributed storage layer for Avro schemas which uses Kafka as its underlying
      storage mechanism.</p>
    <p>You can add additional Kafka configuration properties as needed. When using <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/KafkaSecure"/>, you can
      also configure the origin to use Kafka security features.</p>
    <p>Kafka Consumer includes record header attributes that enable you to use information about the
      record in pipeline processing. </p>

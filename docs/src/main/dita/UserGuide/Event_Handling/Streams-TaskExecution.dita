 <title>Task Execution Streams</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>event streams<indexterm>task execution for stage
                events</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>task execution event
                    streams<indexterm>description</indexterm></indexterm>A task execution stream
            routes event records from the event-generating stage to an executor stage. The executor
            performs a task each time it receives an event record. </p>
        <p>For example, you have a pipeline that reads from Kafka and writes files to HDFS:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/Event-ParquetBasicPipe.png" scale="70" id="image_b5z_25q_tx"
            /></p>
        <p>When Hadoop FS closes a file, you would like the file moved to a different directory and
            the file permissions changed to read-only. </p>
        <p>Leaving the rest of the pipeline as is, you can enable event handling in the Hadoop FS
            destination, connect it to the HDFS File Metadata executor, and configure the HDFS File
            Metadata executor to files and change permissions. The resulting pipeline looks like
            this:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/Event-EventPipe.png" scale="65" id="image_c5z_25q_tx"/></p>
        <p>If you needed to set permissions differently based on the file name or location, you
            could use a Stream Selector to route the event records accordingly, then use two HDFS
            File Metadata executors to alter file permissions, as follows:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/Event-EventPipe-SSelector.png" id="image_os2_nqf_zx" scale="60"
            /></p>
 </conbody>

 <title>Viewing Stage Events in Data Preview and Snapshot</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>event records<indexterm>in data preview and
                snapshot</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>data preview<indexterm>event
                    records</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>snapshot<indexterm>event
                    records</indexterm></indexterm>In data preview and when reviewing snapshots of
            data, stage-related event records display in the event-generating stage marked as "event
            records," and they appear below the batch of standard records.</p>
        <p>After leaving the stage, the record displays like any other record. </p>
        <p>For example, the Directory origin below generates an event record as it starts reading a
            file for data preview:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/Event-DataPreview.png" id="image_jcz_5qq_cy" scale="60"/></p>
        <p>When you select the Local FS destination where the event record is written, you see that
            the same event record no longer displays the event record label. It is treated like any
            other record: </p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/Event-DataPreview-Dest.png" id="image_wlx_4sq_cy" scale="60"
            /></p>

            configure an expression, the Expression Evaluator writes the results of the expression
            to an output field or attribute. You can use an existing field or attribute, or create a
            new one.</p>
        <p>When you use an existing field or attribute, the Expression Evaluator replaces the
            incoming value with the new value. When you use a new field or attribute, the Expression
            Evaluator adds it to the record and passes the results of the expression.</p>

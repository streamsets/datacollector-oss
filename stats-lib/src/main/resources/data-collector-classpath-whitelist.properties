# yes, two different libraries have the gall to name their jar as simply "annotations"
# 2.0.3 is com.google.code.findbugs, which is a dependency of io.airlift:airline
# 4.1.1.4 is com.google.android:annotations, which is a dependency of io.grpc:grpc-core
# they have different packages with no overlap, so there should be no issue loading them both
